# ADR 0016: Parallel Map-Reduce for Summarization Performance

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** Accepted
**Priority:** High
**Related:** [Performance Optimization Initiative](../initiatives/active/performance-optimization-pipeline.md)

---

## Context

The summarization pipeline uses a map-reduce strategy for long documents:

1. **Map phase**: Summarize each chunk individually
2. **Reduce phase**: Combine chunk summaries into final summary

The original implementation processed chunks **sequentially**, which was a significant bottleneck for documents with many chunks (e.g., 10 chunks × 3s/chunk = 30s just for map phase).

### Performance Problem

For a document split into 10 chunks:

- **Sequential**: 10 LLM calls one after another ≈ 30 seconds
- **Opportunity**: All chunks are independent → can parallelize

Industry research (October 2025) shows that **async parallelization** with `asyncio.gather()` can achieve 10x+ speedup for I/O-bound LLM calls.

---

## Decision

**Implement three map-reduce strategies:**

1. **Parallel Map-Reduce** (default, `config.parallel_map=True`)
   - Uses `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` to process all chunks concurrently
   - Fastest option (10x+ speedup for 10 chunks)
   - Results maintain order

2. **Streaming Map-Reduce** (`config.streaming_map=True`)
   - Uses `asyncio.as_completed(tasks)` to stream progress
   - Shows incremental progress as chunks complete
   - Better perceived latency, slightly slower overall

3. **Sequential Map-Reduce** (fallback, both flags=False)
   - Original implementation (backward compatibility)
   - Slowest but most predictable/conservative

### Configuration

```python
class SummarizerSettings(BaseSettings):
    map_reduce_threshold: int = Field(default=8000)  # When to use map-reduce
    parallel_map: bool = Field(default=True)         # Parallel by default
    streaming_map: bool = Field(default=False)       # Opt-in streaming
```

---

## Implementation

### Parallel Map-Reduce (Primary Optimization)

```python
async def _summarize_map_reduce(
    self,
    chunks: list[Chunk],
    query: str | None = None,
    sources: list[str] | None = None,
) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
    """Map-reduce with parallel map phase."""
    
    async def summarize_single_chunk(i: int, chunk: Chunk) -> str:
        """Summarize a single chunk."""
        map_prompt = self._build_map_prompt(chunk.text, query)
        return await self._call_llm_non_streaming(map_prompt)

    # PARALLEL EXECUTION with asyncio.gather
    tasks = [summarize_single_chunk(i, chunk) for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks)]
    chunk_summaries = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    # Reduce phase (sequential, fast)
    combined_summaries = "\n\n".join(f"Section {i+1}:\n{s}" for i, s in enumerate(chunk_summaries))
    reduce_prompt = self._build_reduce_prompt(combined_summaries, query, sources)
    
    async for chunk in self._call_llm(reduce_prompt):
        yield chunk
```

### Streaming Variant (Better UX)

```python
async def _summarize_map_reduce_streaming(
    self,
    chunks: list[Chunk],
    query: str | None = None,
    sources: list[str] | None = None,
) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
    """Map-reduce with streaming progress updates."""
    
    yield f"Processing {len(chunks)} sections...\n\n"
    
    async def summarize_single_chunk(i: int, chunk: Chunk) -> tuple[int, str]:
        map_prompt = self._build_map_prompt(chunk.text, query)
        summary = await self._call_llm_non_streaming(map_prompt)
        return (i, summary)
    
    tasks = [asyncio.create_task(summarize_single_chunk(i, chunk)) 
             for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks)]
    
    chunk_summaries: list[str | None] = [None] * len(chunks)
    
    # Stream results as they complete
    for task in asyncio.as_completed(tasks):
        idx, summary = await task
        chunk_summaries[idx] = summary
        yield f"✓ Section {idx + 1}/{len(chunks)} complete\n"
    
    # Reduce phase
    yield "\nSynthesizing final summary...\n\n"
    # ... (same as parallel variant)
```

---

## Rationale

### Why `asyncio.gather()`?

1. **Perfect for I/O-bound workloads** (LLM API calls)
2. **No GIL issues** (Python GIL doesn't block I/O)
3. **Native async support** (OpenAI client is async)
4. **Simple implementation** (no threads, no multiprocessing overhead)
5. **Proven pattern** (industry standard for concurrent LLM calls)

### Why not threads/multiprocessing?

- **Threads**: GIL limits CPU-bound work (but LLM calls are I/O-bound, so async is better)
- **Multiprocessing**: Heavy overhead (process creation, IPC), unnecessary for I/O

### Expected Performance Improvement

| Document Size | Chunks | Sequential | Parallel | Speedup |
|---------------|--------|------------|----------|---------|
| 10k tokens    | 3-5    | ~12s       | ~3-4s    | 3-4x    |
| 30k tokens    | 10     | ~35s       | ~4-5s    | 7-8x    |
| 100k tokens   | 30     | ~100s      | ~8-10s   | 10x+    |

_Assumptions: 3s average per LLM call, ~1s reduce phase_

---

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **10x+ speedup** for large documents with many chunks
✅ **No quality degradation** - same prompts, same model, same results
✅ **Backward compatible** - can disable via config
✅ **Scalable** - handles arbitrary document sizes
✅ **Industry best practice** - aligns with October 2025 async patterns

### Negative

⚠️ **API rate limits** - May hit provider rate limits with many parallel calls

- **Mitigation**: Already have semaphore-based concurrency control in fetcher; can add same to summarizer if needed

⚠️ **Higher concurrent load** - More simultaneous API connections

- **Mitigation**: Monitor and tune concurrency limits

⚠️ **Cost transparency** - Parallel calls may appear to spike costs

- **Mitigation**: Same total cost, just faster; cost = tokens × rate (unchanged)

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| API rate limit errors | Medium | High | Add semaphore rate limiting |
| Quality regression | Low | Critical | Golden tests validate |
| Increased error rate | Low | Medium | Retry logic already exists |
| Memory usage spike | Low | Low | Chunks already in memory |

## Validation

### Quality Assurance

- [x] All existing golden tests must pass
- [x] No changes to prompts or model (same quality)
- [x] A/B comparison with baseline (sequential)
- [ ] Manual review of 20 sample summaries

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Benchmark: 5k, 10k, 30k, 100k token documents
- [ ] Measure: Sequential vs Parallel vs Streaming
- [ ] Validate: Expected speedup achieved
- [ ] Load test: Concurrent requests with parallel map

### Configuration Testing

- [x] Test all three modes (parallel, streaming, sequential)
- [x] Test config validation
- [x] Test backward compatibility (default=parallel)

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Batch API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)

**Pros:**

- 50% cost savings
- Higher throughput

**Cons:**

- 24-hour processing window (not acceptable for real-time)
- Only for offline/batch processing

**Decision:** Implement in Phase 2 as optional mode for non-real-time use cases

### 2. Local LLM with GPU acceleration

**Pros:**

- No API costs
- Full control
- Lower latency potential

**Cons:**

- Requires GPU
- Deployment complexity
- Model quality trade-offs

**Decision:** Out of scope for this initiative (user can already use local LLMs via config)

### 3. Speculative summarization (pipeline parallelism)

**Pros:**

- Additional 15-25% speedup
- Start summarizing while chunking

**Cons:**

- Complex implementation
- Tight coupling between components
- Risk of wasted work if early stages fail

**Decision:** Defer to Phase 3 (advanced techniques)
