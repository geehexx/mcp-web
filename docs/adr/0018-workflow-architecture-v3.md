# ADR-0018: Workflow Architecture V3 - Taxonomy and Principles

**Status:** Implemented  
**Date:** 2025-10-18  
**Deciders:** @agent  
**Related:** [windsurf-workflows-v2-optimization.md](../initiatives/active/windsurf-workflows-v2-optimization.md), [2025-10-18-workflow-architecture-refactor.md](../initiatives/active/2025-10-18-workflow-architecture-refactor.md)

## Context

During Phase 2 of workflow optimization (v2), we decomposed large workflows into orchestrators calling specialized sub-workflows. This successfully reduced orchestrator size by 52-83%, but revealed deeper architectural issues:

### Problems Identified

1. **Semantic Overlap**
   - `/run-tests` and `/validate` both explain pytest-xdist usage and test types
   - `/commit` duplicates validation checklist from `/validate`
   - Unclear boundaries: Is `/run-tests` a workflow or reference documentation?

2. **Tool Evolution**
   - Deprecated `mcp2_git_*` tool references in `/archive-initiative`
   - Inconsistent tool invocation patterns across workflows
   - No standard documentation for tool usage

3. **Identity Crisis**
   - `/run-tests` contains no orchestration logic, only command reference
   - Located in `.windsurf/workflows/` but functions as documentation
   - Not invoked by other workflows

4. **Lack of Clear Taxonomy**
   - No formal categorization of workflow types
   - Ambiguous decision tree for "which workflow to call when"
   - Difficulty explaining unique value proposition of each workflow

- [9 Agentic AI Workflow Patterns (2025)](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/08/09/9-agentic-ai-workflow-patterns-transforming-ai-agents-in-2025/)

**Key Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**

1. **Creating unnecessary coordination complexity** - Using complex patterns when simple ones suffice
2. **Adding agents without meaningful specialization** - Each workflow must provide unique value
3. **Over-reliance on orchestration** - Tight coupling between workflows and orchestration logic
4. **Service sprawl** - Too many workflows without clear governance

**Recommended Patterns:**

1. **Orchestrator-Worker** - Central orchestrator delegates to specialized workers
2. **Sequential Intelligence** - Prompt chaining, plan-execute loops
3. **Intelligent Routing** - Input classification to specialized handlers
4. **Separation of Concerns** - Each workflow has single, well-defined purpose

---

## Decision

We adopt a **5-category workflow taxonomy** with clear boundaries and anti-pattern validation.

### Category 1: Orchestrators (High-Level Coordination)

**Purpose:** High-level coordination calling multiple sub-workflows

**Characteristics:**

- Call multiple sub-workflows
- Implement orchestration logic
- Route based on context or conditions
- Typically 700-1,300 words

**Workflows:**

- `/work` - Master orchestrator (context detection → routing)
- `/plan` - Planning orchestrator (research → generate-plan → implement)
- `/implement` - Implementation orchestrator (test-first, incremental)
- `/meta-analysis` - Session end orchestrator (extract → summarize → update-docs)

**Anti-Pattern Check:** ✅ Each provides meaningful specialization, no unnecessary complexity

---

### Category 2: Specialized Operations (Focused Tasks)

**Purpose:** Atomic, focused tasks with single responsibility

**Characteristics:**

- Single, well-defined operation
- May call validation or external tools
- Self-contained execution
- Typically 300-1,400 words

**Workflows:**

- `/validate` - Quality gate (lint + test + security)
- `/commit` - Git operations + validation
- `/bump-version` - Semantic versioning from conventional commits
- `/update-docs` - Sync PROJECT_SUMMARY + CHANGELOG
- `/archive-initiative` - Archive completed initiatives

**Tool Standardization:**

- Git operations: `run_command("git [command]", cwd=project_root, blocking=true)`
- Test execution: `run_command("task test:*", cwd=project_root, blocking=true)`
- Validation: `run_command("task format|lint|security", cwd=project_root, blocking=true)`

**Anti-Pattern Check:** ✅ Each has unique atomic operation, no duplication

---

### Category 3: Context Handlers (Information Gathering)

**Purpose:** Information gathering without side effects

**Characteristics:**

- Read-only operations
- Analyze project state
- Return structured data
- Enable autonomous work continuation
- Typically 900-2,000 words

**Workflows:**

- `/detect-context` - Project state analysis for routing (active initiatives, git status, test failures)
- `/load-context` - Batch context loading strategies (3-10x faster than sequential)
- `/extract-session` - Extract structured session data from git history

**Performance Optimization:**

- Batch file reads: `mcp0_read_multiple_files([...])` for 3+ files (3x faster)
- Parallel grep searches where possible
- Cache git log results within session

**Anti-Pattern Check:** ✅ Critical for autonomous continuation, no duplication

---

### Category 4: Artifact Generators (Content Creation)

**Purpose:** Generate structured content/documents

**Characteristics:**

- Create files or documents
- Template-based or AI-generated
- Follow established formats
- Typically 400-2,900 words

**Workflows:**

- `/generate-plan` - Transform research → initiative document
- `/summarize-session` - Generate formatted session summary
- `/new-adr` - ADR creation with research
- `/consolidate-summaries` - Consolidate daily summaries (largest workflow, 2,861 words)

**Note:** `/consolidate-summaries` complexity is justified by its unique consolidation logic

**Anti-Pattern Check:** ✅ Each generates unique artifact type, clear value

---

### Category 5: Reference Guides (Documentation, NOT Workflows)

**Purpose:** Reference documentation for commands and patterns

**Characteristics:**

- **NOT executable workflows**
- Command reference only
- No orchestration logic
- Not invoked by other workflows
- Located in `docs/guides/` (not `.windsurf/workflows/`)

**Documents:**

- `docs/guides/testing-reference.md` (moved from `/run-tests`)
  - Test command reference
  - Pytest-xdist patterns
  - Coverage and debugging commands
  - Marker usage

**Critical Decision:** **Reference guides belong in `docs/guides/`, not `.windsurf/workflows/`**

**Anti-Pattern Check:** ✅ Prevents "workflow without orchestration logic" anti-pattern

---

## Workflow Decision Tree

**When to call which workflow:**

```text
User request arrives
     |
     ├─> "Continue work" / no specific request
     |       └─> Call `/work` (detects context, routes to appropriate workflow)
     |
     ├─> "Create plan for [feature]"
     |       └─> Call `/plan` (research → generate-plan → ready for /implement)
     |
     ├─> "Implement [feature]" (plan exists)
     |       └─> Call `/implement` (test-first, incremental)
     |
     ├─> "Run validation / ready to commit?"
     |       └─> Call `/validate` (lint + test + security gate)
     |
     ├─> "Commit changes"
     |       └─> Call `/commit` (git operations + calls /validate)
     |
     ├─> "Create ADR for [decision]"
     |       └─> Call `/new-adr` (research + document decision)
     |
     ├─> "Archive initiative"
     |       └─> Call `/archive-initiative` (move + update refs)
     |
     ├─> "What tests can I run?"
     |       └─> **Read** `docs/guides/testing-reference.md` (NOT a workflow call)
     |
     └─> Session ending
             └─> Call `/meta-analysis` (MANDATORY, creates session summary)
```

## Standard Tool Invocation Patterns

### File Operations

```yaml
# Batch Read (Always for 3+ files)
mcp0_read_multiple_files(["/abs/path/1", "/abs/path/2", "/abs/path/3"])

# Single Read
read_file("/abs/path/file.py")

# Protected .windsurf/ directory
mcp0_read_text_file("/home/gxx/projects/mcp-web/.windsurf/rules/file.md")
mcp0_write_file("/home/gxx/projects/mcp-web/.windsurf/workflows/file.md", content)
```

### Git Operations

```yaml
# Standard Pattern (NO mcp2_git_* tools)
run_command("git status", cwd=project_root, blocking=true, safe_to_auto_run=true)
run_command("git diff", cwd=project_root, blocking=true, safe_to_auto_run=true)
run_command("git add [files]", cwd=project_root, blocking=true, safe_to_auto_run=false)
run_command("git commit -m '[msg]'", cwd=project_root, blocking=true, safe_to_auto_run=false)
```

### Test Execution

```yaml
run_command("task test:fast", cwd=project_root, blocking=true, safe_to_auto_run=true)
run_command("task test:coverage", cwd=project_root, blocking=true, safe_to_auto_run=true)
```

### Validation

```yaml
run_command("task format:check", cwd=project_root, blocking=true, safe_to_auto_run=true)
run_command("task lint", cwd=project_root, blocking=true, safe_to_auto_run=true)
```

2. **Zero Deprecated Tool References**
   - Migrated from `mcp2_git_*` to standard `git` commands
   - Consistent tool invocation patterns
   - Future-proof against tool changes

3. **Eliminated Semantic Overlap**
   - `/run-tests` moved to reference guide
   - `/validate` vs testing distinction clear
   - `/commit` references `/validate` instead of duplicating

4. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Workflows in `.windsurf/workflows/` are executable

## Notes

- **Date:** 2025-10-18
- **Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours across Phases 1-4
- **Actual Effort (Phases 1-2):** ~3 hours
- **Remaining:** Phases 3-4 (~3-4 hours)

**Migration Strategy:**

- Phase 3 changes are non-breaking for most workflows
- `/run-tests` removal requires cross-reference updates
- Taxonomy is additive (doesn't change existing workflow behavior)
- Tool standardization is backward compatible (git commands work everywhere)
