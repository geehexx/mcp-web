# Initiative: Implement Automated Pull Request Workflow

## Objective

Develop and implement a new `/pull-request` workflow that automates the assembly of pull request descriptions from initiative artifacts. This will streamline the PR process and ensure consistency.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] A new `/pull-request` workflow is created and functional.
- [ ] The workflow correctly assembles PR descriptions by pulling content from initiative artifacts.
- [ ] Documentation for the new workflow is created and added to the project's contributor guides.

---

## Motivation

### Problem

The current process for creating pull requests for initiatives is manual and inconsistent. It relies on contributors to remember to include all relevant information, leading to variability in quality and completeness. This can slow down the review process.

### Value

- Standardized and high-quality PR descriptions.
- Faster and more efficient review process.
- Improved traceability of changes and decisions.

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- Creation of a new `/pull-request` workflow.
- Integration of the workflow with GitHub Actions.
- Documentation of the new system.

### Out of Scope

- Changes to the content of the initiatives themselves.
- The creation of a multi-template PR system (this remains in the parent initiative).

## Updates

- **2025-10-29 â€” Initiative Created:** Migrated from the "Unified Workflows & Rules System Optimization" initiative. The original note stated the need to "...introduce a dedicated `/pull-request` workflow to assemble descriptions from initiative artifacts. These assets are **not yet implemented**; they are queued for the feature branch owner to deliver."
