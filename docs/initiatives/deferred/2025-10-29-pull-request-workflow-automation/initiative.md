# Initiative: Implement Automated Pull Request Workflow

## Objective

Develop and implement a new `/pull-request` workflow that automates the assembly of pull request descriptions from initiative artifacts. This will streamline the PR process, ensure consistency, and improve the traceability of changes.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] A new `/pull-request` GitHub Actions workflow is created and functional.
- [ ] The workflow correctly assembles PR descriptions by pulling content from initiative artifacts (e.g., title, objective, phases).
- [ ] The workflow is triggered via a slash command (e.g., `/pull-request`) in a PR comment.
- [ ] Documentation for the new workflow is created and added to the project's contributor guides.
- [ ] The new system is adopted for all future initiative-related pull requests.

---

## Motivation

### Problem

The current process for creating pull requests for initiatives is manual and inconsistent. It relies on contributors to remember to include all relevant information, leading to variability in quality and completeness. This can slow down the review process and make it harder to track the progress and context of initiatives.

### Value

- **Consistency:** Standardized and high-quality PR descriptions for all initiatives.
- **Efficiency:** Faster and more efficient review process for contributors and reviewers.
- **Traceability:** Improved ability to track changes and decisions from the PR back to the original planning documents.

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- Creation of a new `/pull-request` GitHub Actions workflow.
- Integration of the workflow with GitHub slash commands.
- Logic to parse initiative markdown files and extract relevant sections.
- Documentation of the new workflow and its usage.

### Out of Scope

- Changes to the content of the initiatives themselves.
- The creation of a multi-template PR system (this remains in the parent initiative).
- Any changes to the core logic of the build or validation scripts.

---

## Phases

- **Phase 1: Research & Design**
  - Investigate GitHub Actions slash command integrations.
  - Design the workflow logic and the mapping between initiative sections and PR template fields.
  - Define the schema for the initiative artifacts that the workflow will parse.
- **Phase 2: Implementation**
  - Develop the GitHub Actions workflow file.
  - Write the script to parse the initiative files.
  - Implement the logic to assemble the PR description.
- **Phase 3: Testing & Validation**
  - Create a test repository or a test PR to validate the workflow.
  - Manually trigger the workflow and verify the output.
  - Add unit tests for the parsing script.
- **Phase 4: Documentation & Rollout**
  - Write clear and concise documentation for the new workflow.
  - Announce the new workflow to the team and provide training if necessary.

---

## Dependencies

- The initiative markdown files must have a consistent and machine-readable structure for the parsing script to work reliably.
- The project must have a GitHub Actions runner available to execute the workflow.

---

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Parsing logic is brittle | Medium | Medium | Develop a robust parsing script with good error handling and unit tests. |
| GitHub Actions permissions | Low | Low | Ensure the workflow has the necessary permissions to read files and update PR descriptions. |
| Low adoption | Low | Low | Provide clear documentation and training to encourage adoption. |

---

## Timeline & Effort

| Phase | Effort |
|-------|--------|
| Phase 1: Research & Design | 1-2 hours |
| Phase 2: Implementation | 2-3 hours |
| Phase 3: Testing & Validation | 1-2 hours |
| Phase 4: Documentation & Rollout | 1 hour |
| **Total** | **5-8 hours** |

---

## Metrics

- **Adoption Rate:** % of new initiative PRs that use the new workflow.
- **Time to Merge:** Average time to merge for initiative PRs (to see if it improves).

---

## Artifacts

- A new GitHub Actions workflow file in `.github/workflows/`.
- A new parsing script in `scripts/automation/`.
- New documentation in the contributor guides.

---

## Testing & Validation Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:** The parsing script will have unit tests to ensure it can correctly parse initiative files.
2. **Integration Tests:** The workflow will be tested in a controlled environment (e.g., a test PR) to ensure it integrates correctly with GitHub.
3. **Manual Verification:** The output of the workflow will be manually verified to ensure it is correct and well-formatted.

---

## Updates

- **2025-10-29 â€” Initiative Created:** Migrated from the "Unified Workflows & Rules System Optimization" initiative. The original note stated the need to "...introduce a dedicated `/pull-request` workflow to assemble descriptions from initiative artifacts. These assets are **not yet implemented**; they are queued for the feature branch owner to deliver."
