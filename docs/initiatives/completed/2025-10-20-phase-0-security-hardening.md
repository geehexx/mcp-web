# Initiative: Phase 0 - Security Hardening

## Deployment Blocker - Must Complete Before Production Release

---

## Objective

Eliminate P0 security vulnerabilities to achieve minimal security posture required for production deployment, focusing on prompt injection prevention, authentication implementation, and comprehensive security testing.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Prompt injection detection system implemented (≥90% detection rate)
- [ ] Content sanitization framework with comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Authentication middleware implemented (API key minimum, OAuth optional)
- [ ] Zero RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerabilities in security scans
- [ ] Security test suite passing in CI (OWASP LLM Top 10 coverage)
- [ ] Threat model documented
- [ ] SECURITY.md created for responsible disclosure
- [ ] All security findings from Bandit/Semgrep addressed

---

## Motivation

**Problem:**

Current mcp-web implementation lacks critical security controls for production deployment:

1. **Prompt Injection (OWASP LLM-01)**: Scraped web content flows directly to LLM without sanitization, enabling trivial prompt injection attacks
2. **Missing Authentication**: No authentication/authorization controls allow unrestricted access to MCP tools
3. **Security Testing Gap**: No comprehensive security test suite for LLM-specific vulnerabilities

**Impact:**

- **Without this:** Deployment risk is unacceptable - easy data exfiltration via prompt injection
- **With this:** Minimal viable security posture for controlled production deployment
- **Blockers:** This initiative gates all deployment decisions

**Value:**

- **Security:** Prevent prompt injection, unauthorized access, data exfiltration
- **Compliance:** Meet OWASP LLM Top 10 requirements
- **Trust:** Enable confident deployment to users

## Updates

### 2025-10-20 (Creation)

Initiative created based on comprehensive technical roadmap analysis.

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Layered Defense**: Sanitization + detection + validation (defense-in-depth)
2. **API Key First**: OAuth deferred to v0.4.0 (pragmatic approach)
3. **Pattern + ML**: Hybrid detection for best accuracy vs performance
4. **Security as Default**: Auth required by default, explicit opt-out only

**Research Findings:**

- OWASP LLM Top 10 2025: Prompt injection remains #1 threat
- MCP OAuth 2.1: Alibaba disclosure highlights PKCE + state validation requirements
- Detection Accuracy: Pattern-based achieves 70-80%, ML can reach 90-95%
- Performance: Sanitization typically <5ms overhead, detection <10ms

**Next Steps:**

1. Phase 1: Security audit (identify all attack surfaces)
2. Phase 2: Implement sanitization + detection
3. Phase 3: Add authentication middleware
4. Phase 4: Comprehensive security testing
5. Phase 5: Security sign-off

**Existing Implementation Audit:**

Analyzed current codebase (`src/mcp_web/security.py`):

✅ **Strong Foundation:**

- `PromptInjectionDetector` with pattern matching implemented
- `OutputValidator` for sensitive information filtering
- `RateLimiter` with token bucket algorithm
- `ConsumptionLimits` for resource enforcement
- `validate_url()` for SSRF prevention
- `create_structured_prompt()` for instruction separation

❌ **Gaps Identified:**

- No API key authentication middleware
- Prompt injection detector needs enhancement (typoglycemia, multilingual)
- No integration with MCP server authentication flow
- Missing output sanitization (HTML/script removal)
- No Garak integration for comprehensive testing
- Security test coverage incomplete (~60%, need 90%+)

**Architecture Document Created:**

Created comprehensive security architecture (`docs/security/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`):

- 9 major sections covering full threat model
- Defense-in-depth architecture (6 layers)
- Component-by-component security design
- Authentication strategy (API key v0.3.0, OAuth 2.1 v0.4.0)
- Garak integration guide
- Security testing pyramid (unit → integration → E2E)
- Configuration examples and deployment guidance

**Implementation Plan Refined:**

Based on research and audit, updated approach:

**Phase 1: Enhanced Prompt Injection Prevention (Week 1, Days 1-3)**

- Extend `PromptInjectionDetector` with:
  - Typoglycemia detection (scrambled keywords)
  - Multilingual attack patterns (French, German, etc.)
  - Adversarial suffix detection
  - Confidence scoring (0-1.0 scale)
- Implement content sanitization:
  - HTML tag stripping (scripts, styles, event handlers)
  - Unicode normalization
  - Character repetition removal
- Add structured prompt enhancement:
  - Clear delimiter boundaries (`---`)
  - Explicit security rules section
  - Instructional prevention
- **Tests:** 25+ test cases covering OWASP scenarios

**Phase 2: Authentication Middleware (Week 1, Days 4-5)**

- Create `src/mcp_web/auth.py`:
  - `APIKeyAuthenticator` class
  - Bearer token validation (Authorization header)
  - Rate limiting per API key
  - Audit logging (authentication events)
- MCP server integration:
  - Authentication middleware in `mcp_server.py`
  - Configuration (enable/disable, API keys)
  - Error responses (401 Unauthorized)
- OAuth 2.1 foundation:
  - Document OAuth flow (implementation deferred)
  - Create stub `OAuth21Authenticator` class
- **Tests:** 15+ test cases for auth flows

**Phase 3: Output Validation Enhancement (Week 2, Days 1-2)**

- Extend `OutputValidator`:
  - System prompt leakage patterns
  - API key exposure detection
  - Internal reasoning leak prevention
  - Length limits enforcement
- Implement output sanitization:
  - Safe response filtering
  - Structured error messages
- **Tests:** 12+ test cases for output scenarios

**Phase 4: Comprehensive Security Testing (Week 2, Days 3-4)**

- OWASP LLM Top 10 test suite:
  - `tests/security/test_owasp_llm01_prompt_injection.py`
  - `tests/security/test_owasp_llm02_information_disclosure.py`
  - `tests/security/test_owasp_llm05_output_handling.py`
  - `tests/security/test_owasp_llm10_unbounded_consumption.py`
- Garak integration:
  - Install garak: `uv pip install garak`
  - Create scan script: `scripts/security_scan.sh`
  - Document scan procedures
  - Baseline report: target 90%+ pass rate
- Security CI/CD:
  - Add security test stage to GitHub Actions
  - Bandit + Semgrep integration
  - Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Tests:** 40+ security test cases total

**Phase 5: Documentation & Sign-off (Week 2, Day 5)**

- Create `SECURITY.md` (responsible disclosure)
- Document threat model
- Create ADRs:
  - ADR-00XX: Pattern-Based Prompt Injection Detection
  - ADR-00XX: API Key Authentication Strategy
  - ADR-00XX: Structured Prompt Architecture
- Update API documentation with security guidance
- Security review checklist
- **Deliverables:** 4 docs + 3 ADRs

**Key Architectural Decisions:**

1. **Pattern-Based Detection (v0.3.0)** - Prioritize simplicity and speed
   - Rationale: 80-90% detection rate with zero ML dependencies
   - Trade-off: Lower accuracy than ML, but faster and simpler
   - Future: ML-based classification in v0.4.0 for 95%+ accuracy

2. **API Key Auth First, OAuth Later** - Pragmatic staging
   - Rationale: MCP servers often run locally, OAuth adds complexity
   - v0.3.0: API key with rate limiting (sufficient for local deployment)
   - v0.4.0: OAuth 2.1 + PKCE for production-scale deployments

3. **Structured Prompts with Delimiters** - OWASP recommended defense
   - Rationale: Clear SYSTEM vs USER_DATA separation prevents confusion
   - Implementation: `---` boundaries + security rules section
   - Trade-off: +10% token overhead, but significantly more secure

4. **Defense-in-Depth, Not Perfect Defense** - Realistic security posture
   - Rationale: Prompt injection is an arms race, no perfect solution exists
   - Strategy: 6-layer defense reduces attack surface by 90%+
   - Monitoring: Continuous detection and logging for rapid response

**Metrics & Targets:**

- **Detection Rate:** 90%+ for known prompt injection patterns
- **False Positive Rate:** <5% on benign content
- **Test Coverage:** 90%+ for security modules
- **Performance Overhead:** <5% latency increase for security checks
- **Garak Scan:** 90%+ pass rate on comprehensive vulnerability suite

**Next Steps:**

1. **Immediate:** Begin Phase 1 implementation (enhanced prompt injection detection)
2. **This Week:** Complete Phases 1-2 (detection + authentication)
3. **Next Week:** Complete Phases 3-5 (validation + testing + docs)
4. **Target Completion:** 2025-11-03 (on track, 2 weeks total)

**Blockers:** None identified

**Risk Assessment:** Low - Strong foundation exists, clear implementation path defined
