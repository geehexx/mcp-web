# Initiative: Task System Validation and Enforcement

---

## Objective

Implement automated validation and enforcement for task system compliance to prevent recurring violations despite mandatory rules. Create pre-commit hooks and validation scripts that catch violations immediately before they're committed.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Pre-commit hook blocks commits with task format violations
- [x] Validation script detects all 3 violation types (missing prefix, removed tasks, wrong attribution)
- [x] Clear error messages with examples for each violation type
- [x] 100% detection rate on known historical violations
- [x] Bypass mechanism available (--no-verify) for edge cases
- [x] Documentation updated with validation process
- [x] Tests pass with 100% violation detection accuracy

---

## Motivation

**Problem:**

Task system violations occurred **3 times** in Oct 18-19 sessions despite mandatory rules:

- Missing workflow prefixes (`/implement`, `/validate`, etc.)
- Removing completed tasks during updates (losing work history)
- Wrong workflow attribution (orchestrator vs executor confusion)

Manual enforcement is insufficient - violations happen under cognitive load during rapid implementation (26 files in Phase 5). No programmatic prevention exists.

**Impact:**

- **HIGH** - Violations break progress tracking visibility
- **Confuses responsibility** - Unclear which workflow owns what
- **Undermines adoption** - Rules without enforcement lose credibility
- **Manual detection only** - Caught post-factum during review, not prevention

**Value:**

- **CRITICAL** - Automated validation catches violations immediately
- **Prevents publication** - Non-compliant updates blocked at commit
- **Maintains integrity** - Task history preserved automatically
- **No cognitive overhead** - Enforced standards without remembering

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- Pre-commit hook for task format validation
- Validation script checking workflow prefix presence
- Detection of removed completed tasks between updates
- Correct workflow attribution verification (executor vs orchestrator)
- Hierarchical numbering validation (1, 1.1, 1.1.1 format)
- Clear error messages with WRONG/CORRECT examples
- Test suite with known violation examples
- Documentation of validation process

### Out of Scope

- Retroactive fix of historical violations (analysis already done)
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline (Phase 2 future enhancement)
- Dashboard/monitoring UI for violation trends
- Auto-correction of violations (suggest only, don't auto-fix)
- Real-time validation during conversation (pre-commit only)

---

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Validation Script (3 hours) ✅

- [x] Design validation rules based on Section 1.11
- [x] Implement task format checker (workflow prefix validator)
- [x] Add completed task preservation check (detect removals)
- [x] Add attribution validator (orchestrator vs executor)
- [x] Add hierarchical numbering validator
- [x] Create test suite with 10+ violation examples from Phase 5
- [x] Document usage in scripts/README.md

### Phase 2: Pre-commit Integration (2 hours) ✅

- [x] Create pre-commit hook script
- [x] Integrate with `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- [x] Add bypass mechanism (`git commit --no-verify`)
- [x] Test hook on known violations (should block)
- [x] Test hook on valid updates (should pass)
- [x] Document in commit workflow

### Phase 3: Enhanced Reporting (1-2 hours) ✅

- [x] Add violation report generation (markdown format)
- [x] Create fix suggestions for each violation type
- [x] Add metrics tracking (violations per session)
- [x] Create common violations guide with examples
- [x] Add severity levels (critical, warning, info)

### Phase 4: Validation (1 hour) ✅

- [x] Test on historical violations from Phase 5
- [x] Verify all 3 violation types caught
- [x] Run on current codebase (should pass)
- [x] Update Section 1.11 with validation references
- [x] Archive this initiative

**Resolved Blockers:**

- None

## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies:**

- **Section 1.11 (Agent Directives)** (Documentation)
  - Status: Complete (enhanced with anti-patterns)
  - Critical Path: Yes (defines validation rules)
  - Notes: Source of truth for task format requirements

- **Task System Fix Session** (Documentation)
  - Status: Complete (violation analysis done)
  - Critical Path: Yes (provides test cases)
  - Notes: Contains real examples for validation tests

**External Dependencies:**

- **Python standard library** - No additional dependencies
- **pre-commit framework** - Already installed

**Prerequisite Initiatives:**

- None (standalone improvement)

**Blocks These Initiatives:**

- None (nice-to-have enforcement, not blocking other work)

## Related Initiatives

**Synergistic:**

- [Workflow Automation Enhancement](../2025-10-18-workflow-automation-enhancement/initiative.md) - Similar automation philosophy (Phase 1-6)
- [Windsurf Workflows V2](../2025-10-17-windsurf-workflows-v2-optimization/initiative.md) - Quality automation patterns (Phase 8)

**Sequential Work:**

- Task system violations fixed (Oct 19) → This initiative → Ongoing compliance

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| False positives blocking valid updates | Medium | Medium | Thorough testing with edge cases, bypass mechanism available |
| Validation too slow (>1s) | Low | Low | Optimize for common case, cache parsing results |
| Edge cases not caught | Medium | Low | Comprehensive test suite with historical violations |
| Developers bypass validation | Medium | Medium | Make validation fast, clear error messages, document why important |

---

## Timeline

- **Week 1 (5h):** Phase 1-2 - Core validation + pre-commit integration
- **Week 2 (2-3h):** Phase 3-4 - Enhanced reporting + validation

**Total:** 7-8 hours across 2 weeks

## Updates

### 2025-10-19 (Creation)

Initiative created based on analysis of 3 task system violation incidents in Oct 18-19.

**Evidence:**

- Phase 5 violations: Missing prefixes, removed tasks, wrong attribution
- Phase 4 violations: Similar patterns
- Oct 19 fix session: Comprehensive analysis completed

**Rationale:**

- Documentation alone insufficient (violations occurred despite mandatory rules)
- Cognitive load during rapid work leads to shortcuts
- Programmatic enforcement needed for consistent compliance

**Next:** Phase 1 - Design and implement validation script
