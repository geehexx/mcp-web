# Phase 3: Missing Tests

**Status:** ✓ Completed 2025-10-15
**Duration:** 2 days
**Owner:** Core Team

---

## Objective

Fill critical gaps in test coverage with query-aware, Playwright fallback, and robots.txt tests.

---

## Test Suites Created

### Query-Aware Summarization Tests (11 scenarios)

- [x] Simple query matching
- [x] Complex multi-term queries
- [x] Query with no matches
- [x] Query-focused chunk selection
- [x] Query in map-reduce context

### Playwright Fallback Tests (18 test cases)

- [x] Detect JS-rendered content
- [x] Fallback on httpx failure
- [x] Wait for network idle
- [x] Extract from SPA
- [x] Handle Playwright errors gracefully

### robots.txt Tests (25 test cases)

- [x] Respect robots.txt by default
- [x] Parse and check disallow rules
- [x] Handle crawl-delay
- [x] Ignore robots.txt when configured
- [x] Handle missing robots.txt

### Edge Case Tests

- [x] Very long documents (>100k tokens)
- [x] Binary content (images, PDFs)
- [x] Malformed HTML
- [x] Timeout handling
- [x] Network errors

---

## Deliverables

- ✅ `tests/golden/test_golden_extraction.py` - Query-aware tests
- ✅ `tests/integration/test_playwright_fallback.py` - JS rendering tests
- ✅ `tests/integration/test_robots_txt.py` - robots.txt compliance tests
- ✅ `tests/integration/test_edge_cases.py` - Edge case handling

---

## Coverage Impact

- Added 54 new test cases
- Covered previously untested scenarios
- Increased confidence in critical path features

---

## Completion Notes

All missing test scenarios implemented and passing. Comprehensive coverage of query-aware summarization, Playwright fallback, and robots.txt handling achieved.
