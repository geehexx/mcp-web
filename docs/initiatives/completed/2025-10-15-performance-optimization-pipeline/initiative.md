# Initiative: Performance Optimization Pipeline

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive performance optimization initiative to profile, benchmark, and optimize the entire mcp-web pipeline with focus on reducing summarization latency from current baseline to well under 5 seconds while maintaining or improving quality.

### Key Goals

1. **Profiling & Monitoring**: Build reusable profiling tools and comprehensive monitoring
2. **Baseline Metrics**: Establish current performance baselines across all components
3. **Optimization Phases**: Implement optimizations in 3 phased approaches
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure zero quality regression through golden tests
5. **Future-Proof**: Create extensible framework for continuous optimization

### Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Summarization completes in <5 seconds for typical web pages (5-10k tokens)
- ‚úÖ 90%+ quality retention vs baseline (measured via golden tests)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive profiling tools for ongoing monitoring
- ‚úÖ Scalable to 10x current workload
- ‚úÖ Cost reduction through batch processing where applicable

---

## Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation & Quick Wins** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

Key achievements:

- ‚úÖ Parallel map-reduce implementation (1.17x speedup)
- ‚úÖ Profiling infrastructure and benchmark suite
- ‚úÖ Prompt optimization (45-60% reduction)
- ‚úÖ Adaptive `max_tokens` and stop sequences
- ‚úÖ Golden tests for quality validation

**Phase 2: Advanced Optimizations** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

All objectives achieved:

- ‚úÖ Content-based summarization caching (30-50% latency reduction)
- ‚úÖ Streaming implementation (available via streaming_map)
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical/adaptive chunking (validated)
- ‚úÖ Content-aware routing (implemented)
- ‚è≥ Batch processing (deferred to future work)

---

## Phases

This initiative is organized into distinct optimization phases:

1. [Phase 1: Foundation & Quick Wins](phases/phase-1-foundation-quick-wins.md) - ‚úÖ Complete
2. [Phase 2: Advanced Optimizations](phases/phase-2-advanced-optimizations.md) - ‚úÖ Complete
3. Phase 3 & 4: Deferred - Not scoped in this initiative

**Phase 1** (2 days) delivered foundational optimizations:

- Parallel map-reduce (1.17x-1.58x speedup)
- Prompt optimization (45-60% token reduction)
- Adaptive max_tokens and profiling infrastructure

**Phase 2** (4 days) achieved all critical objectives:
