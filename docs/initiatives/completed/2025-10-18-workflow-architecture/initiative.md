# Initiative: Workflow Architecture Refactor

**Status:** ✅ Completed (Archived)
**Created:** 2025-10-18
**Completed:** 2025-10-18
**Target Completion:** 2025-10-25
**Owner:** @agent
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours
**Actual Effort:** ~6 hours (Phases 1-3 completed same day)

## Context

During Phase 2 of workflow optimization (v2), we identified deeper architectural issues that go beyond simple decomposition:

1. **Semantic Overlap:** Multiple workflows serve similar purposes with unclear boundaries
2. **Tool Evolution:** References to deprecated tools (`mcp2_git_*`) scattered throughout
3. **Duplication:** Common patterns repeated across workflows (validation, testing, git operations)
4. **Purpose Drift:** Some workflows have grown beyond their original scope

**Source:** Feedback during windsurf-workflows-v2-optimization Phase 2 completion

**Research Reference:** [Azure AI Agent Orchestration Patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns) - Anti-patterns section highlights:

- "Creating unnecessary coordination complexity"
- "Adding agents that don't provide meaningful specialization"

**Supporting Artifacts:**

- [Comprehensive Workflow Audit](artifacts/workflow-audit.md) - Complete 18-workflow analysis with taxonomy validation

---

## Objective

Restructure workflows to eliminate semantic overlap, establish clear boundaries, and ensure each workflow provides meaningful specialization.

**Core Principle:** Each workflow should have a single, well-defined purpose that doesn't overlap with others.

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] Clear workflow taxonomy defined (categorization by purpose) ✅
- [x] Zero tool reference errors (all use correct tools) ✅
- [x] Duplication eliminated (DRY principle applied) ✅
- [x] Each workflow has unique value proposition ✅
- [x] Integration points clearly documented ✅
- [x] All workflows follow consistent patterns ✅
- [x] Documentation reflects new architecture ✅

**Verification:**

- ✅ Grep for deprecated tool references: `grep -r "mcp2_" .windsurf/workflows/` returns empty
- ✅ Manual review confirms no semantic overlap (run-tests moved to guides/)
- ✅ Each workflow can explain "what makes it different from X" (taxonomy categorization)

## Research Summary

### Current Issues Identified

**1. Semantic Overlap Examples:**

| Workflow | Purpose (Current) | Overlaps With | Issue |
|----------|------------------|---------------|-------|
| `/run-tests` | Test execution reference | `/validate` | Both explain pytest-xdist, test types |
| `/validate` | Quality gate (lint+test+security) | `/run-tests`, `/commit` | Testing logic duplicated |
| `/commit` | Git operations + validation | `/validate` | Validation checklist duplicated |

**2. Tool Reference Issues:**

- `/commit` references `mcp2_git_status`, `mcp2_git_diff_unstaged`, `mcp2_git_add`, `mcp2_git_commit`, `mcp2_git_log`
- These tools no longer exist (MCP git server not in use)
- Should use standard `git` commands via `run_command` tool

**3. Purpose Ambiguity:**

- Is `/run-tests` a workflow or documentation?
- Does `/validate` orchestrate or document?
- When to call `/validate` vs `/run-tests`?

### Proposed Taxonomy

**Category 1: Orchestrators** (High-level coordination)

- `/work` - Master orchestrator
- `/plan` - Planning orchestrator
- `/implement` - Implementation orchestrator

**Category 2: Specialized Operations** (Focused tasks)

- `/validate` - Quality gate (atomic operation)
- `/commit` - Git operations (atomic operation)
- `/bump-version` - Versioning (atomic operation)
- `/update-docs` - Documentation sync (atomic operation)

**Category 3: Context Handlers** (Information gathering)

- `/detect-context` - Project state analysis
- `/load-context` - Batch context loading
- `/extract-session` - Session data extraction

**Category 4: Artifact Generators** (Content creation)

- `/generate-plan` - Plan document generation
- `/summarize-session` - Session summary generation
- `/new-adr` - ADR creation

**Category 5: Reference Guides** (Documentation, not workflows)

- Move `/run-tests` to `docs/guides/testing-reference.md`
- Keep only true workflows in `.windsurf/workflows/`

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**

- windsurf-workflows-v2-optimization Phase 1 ✅ (Complete)
- windsurf-workflows-v2-optimization Phase 2 ✅ (Complete)

**Blockers:**

- None (can start immediately)

---

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking existing workflow chains | Medium | High | Test all integration points, add deprecation warnings before removal |
| User confusion during transition | Low | Medium | Document changes clearly, provide migration guide |
| Scope creep (too many changes) | High | Medium | Strict adherence to taxonomy, defer non-critical changes |
| Missing edge cases in tool references | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive grep + manual review + testing |

**Out of Scope:**

- New workflow features (focus on restructuring only)
- Performance optimization (separate initiative)
- AI model improvements (separate concern)

---

## ADRs

- [ ] ADR-XXXX: Workflow Architecture V3 - Taxonomy and Principles

**ADR Required:** Yes - Significant architectural change affecting all workflows

---

## Related Documentation

- `docs/initiatives/active/windsurf-workflows-v2-optimization.md` - Parent initiative
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md` - Will be updated
- `.windsurf/workflows/*.md` - All workflow files affected
- `.windsurf/rules/00_agent_directives.md` - May need updates for tool patterns

---

## Phase Updates

### 2025-10-18 - Phase 1 Completion

Initiative created based on feedback during Phase 2 of workflow optimization. Identified need for deeper architectural refactor beyond simple decomposition.

**Trigger:** User feedback: "There's very heavy overlap and redundancy between workflows... we might want to re-think at a higher level the purpose of the workflows"

**Decision:** Create separate initiative to avoid scope creep in v2-optimization. This allows focused work on architecture without derailing token optimization.

---

## Success Metrics

**Quantitative:**

- Deprecated tool references: 0 (currently: ~10)
- Workflow semantic overlap: 0 (currently: 3 pairs identified)
- Reference docs in workflows/: 0 (move to docs/guides/)

**Qualitative:**

- Each workflow can articulate unique value in 1 sentence
- Clear decision tree for "which workflow to call when"
- Consistent tool invocation patterns across all workflows

**Time:**

- Estimated: 8-12 hours across 2-3 sessions
- Target completion: 1 week from start

---

## Future Considerations

**Post-refactor opportunities:**

- Workflow versioning system
- Automated workflow testing framework
- Workflow performance profiling
- AI-generated workflow suggestions based on context

**Dependencies on this initiative:**

- Token optimization (Phase 3) should wait for architecture stabilization
- Any new workflow creation should follow new taxonomy
- Documentation updates should reflect new structure

---
