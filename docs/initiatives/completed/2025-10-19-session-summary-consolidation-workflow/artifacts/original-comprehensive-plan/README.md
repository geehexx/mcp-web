# Original Comprehensive Mining System Plan (SUPERSEDED)

**Status:** Superseded by pragmatic split
**Date Superseded:** 2025-10-19
**Original Initiative:** Session Summary Mining & Action Item Extraction System

---

## What Happened

This was the original comprehensive plan for session summary mining with full LLM automation. After strategic analysis, it was split into three pragmatic initiatives to avoid reinventing the wheel and deliver immediate value.

---

## Why Superseded

**Key Insight:** Don't duplicate MCP server's summarization capabilities.

**Problems with original plan:**

- Would require 15-20 hours for full LLM extraction pipeline
- Duplicates MCP server functionality (reinventing wheel)
- Cannot use MCP internally until file system support added
- Delays immediate value (processing Oct 15-19 summaries)

---

## What Replaced It

Split into 3 initiatives following 80/20 principle:

### 1. Session Summary Consolidation Workflow (NOW) âœ… In Progress

**Path:** `../initiative.md`
**Duration:** 3-4 hours
**Value:** Manual good-enough workflow for immediate use
**Status:** Phase 1 complete (workflow enhanced)

### 2. MCP File System Support (ENABLES)

**Path:** `../../2025-10-19-mcp-file-system-support/initiative.md`
**Duration:** 6-8 hours
**Value:** Unblocks internal use of MCP server for local files
**Status:** Ready to start

### 3. Session Summary Mining - Advanced (LATER)

**Path:** `../../2025-10-19-session-summary-mining-advanced/initiative.md`
**Duration:** 12-15 hours
**Value:** LLM automation using MCP internally (scalable to 100+ summaries)
**Status:** Blocked by #2

## What Was Preserved

All research and analysis from the original plan was preserved in this directory:

- **[initiative.md](initiative.md)** - Original comprehensive plan
- **[artifacts/research-summary.md](artifacts/research-summary.md)** - 6 authoritative sources, best practices
- **[artifacts/summary-analysis.md](artifacts/summary-analysis.md)** - Analysis of 21 summaries, patterns identified
- **[phases/phase-2-extraction-pipeline.md](phases/phase-2-extraction-pipeline.md)** - Technical design (ready for Phase 3 implementation)

This research is not wasted - it will be used when implementing the advanced automation initiative.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Pragmatic over perfect:** Manual process acceptable for 21 summaries
2. **Avoid duplication:** Reuse MCP server instead of building separate extraction system
3. **Deliver incrementally:** NOW (manual) + LATER (automated) better than 3-4 week delay
4. **Foundation first:** File system support needed before internal MCP use
5. **Research preserved:** Original comprehensive work informs future automation
