# Initiative: Session Summary Mining & Action Item Extraction System

---

## Objective

Develop an end-to-end system for mining session summaries (Oct 15-18, 2025) to extract actionable insights, validate against current initiatives, and automatically create or update initiatives based on discovered pain points, missing workflows, and regressions.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 21 session summaries from 2025-10-15 through 2025-10-19 analyzed
- [ ] Comprehensive action item backlog created with metadata (source, impact, confidence, dependencies)
- [ ] All action items cross-referenced against current initiatives and code
- [ ] Missing gaps converted into new initiatives following repository standards
- [ ] Enhanced `/consolidate-summaries` workflow accepts flexible inputs (files, globs, queries)
- [ ] Extraction pipeline is idempotent and safely testable (dry-run mode)
- [ ] All changes committed with zero unapproved modifications during validation
- [ ] Complete session end protocol executed (meta-analysis, archiving, documentation)

---

## Motivation

### Problem

Current workflow gaps:

1. **No systematic knowledge mining**: Session summaries contain valuable insights that get lost over time
2. **Manual action item tracking**: Pain points and improvement opportunities identified in summaries aren't systematically captured
3. **Initiative creation lag**: Gaps discovered during work aren't converted into tracked initiatives
4. **consolidate-summaries limited**: Current workflow only handles same-day consolidation, not cross-summary mining
5. **No deduplication**: Same issue mentioned across multiple sessions creates duplicate work

### Impact

- **Lost insights**: Regression patterns, missing workflows, and pain points identified but forgotten
- **Reactive vs proactive**: Waiting for issues to surface instead of mining historical data
- **Incomplete initiative coverage**: Current 3 active initiatives don't reflect all discovered gaps
- **Manual overhead**: Reading 21 summaries manually to extract patterns is time-consuming and error-prone

### Value

- **Systematic improvement**: Convert session insights into tracked, actionable initiatives
- **Pattern detection**: Identify pervasive pain points across multiple sessions
- **Complete coverage**: Ensure all discovered gaps have corresponding initiatives
- **Knowledge retention**: Session summaries become living sources of continuous improvement
- **Automation**: 80% reduction in manual analysis time

## Current Status

**Phase 1: Research & Analysis** ✅ **COMPLETE**

Research completed on:

- **NLP Extraction Techniques**: Rule-based, ML, deep learning (BERT, GPT)
- **Knowledge Management 2025**: AI automation, knowledge discovery, GenAI patterns
- **Deduplication Strategies**: Information retrieval, ML approaches, similarity metrics
- **Structured Extraction**: Simon Willison LLM schemas, Instructor Pydantic patterns
- **Action Item Extraction**: Meeting summarization, hierarchical structures

**Key Findings:**

- Structured extraction with Pydantic + LLM achieves 85-95% accuracy
- Deduplication via similarity + context comparison reduces duplicates 70-90%
- Hierarchical action items (ticket → subtask) improve organization
- YAML 30% more token-efficient than JSON for LLM generation
- Cross-reference validation critical to avoid duplicate initiatives

**Next:** Phase 2 - Design extraction pipeline with validated patterns

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Extraction accuracy <85% | High | Medium | Use validated Pydantic patterns, add human review checkpoint |
| High duplicate rate (>50%) | Medium | Low | Implement multi-level deduplication (text similarity + semantic + context) |
| Breaking consolidate-summaries | High | Low | Create new sub-workflow, preserve original functionality |
| Creating duplicate initiatives | High | Medium | Comprehensive cross-reference validation before creation |
| LLM API costs high | Low | Medium | Use batch processing, caching, token-efficient YAML format |
| Scope creep (beyond Oct 15-19) | Medium | Medium | Strict date filtering, defer future enhancements to Phase 2 |
