# Initiative: Workflow Artifacts & Transparency Improvements

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2025-10-18
**Owner:** @ai-agent
**Priority:** Critical
**Estimated Duration:** 4-6 hours
**Target Completion:** 2025-10-18

## Objective

Fix systemic issues with workflow task numbering, transparency, and artifact management to improve user experience and maintain consistency with established conventions.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All workflows use hierarchical task numbering (1, 1.1, 1.2.1, etc.)
- [ ] All workflows include workflow prefix in task names
- [ ] Task updates visible to user with announcements
- [ ] File structure violations resolved
- [ ] Missing workflow integrations added (version bump, ADR creation)
- [ ] Section numbering consistent across all workflows
- [ ] Rules updated with mandatory requirements
- [ ] Can demonstrate working examples

## Motivation

**Problem:**

1. User can't see progress (silent task updates)
2. Can't tell which workflow created which task (no prefixes)
3. File structure violations (both flat and folder created)
4. No hierarchical numbering (can't reference subtasks)
5. Missing workflow calls (version bump, ADR creation not triggered)

**Impact:**

- User confusion and frustration
- Lost track of work progress
- Inconsistent with PM industry standards (WBS numbering)
- Violates our own documentation standards

**Value:**

- Clear visibility into agent progress
- Professional task management (follows MS Project conventions)
- Consistent artifact organization
- Better debugging and issue tracking

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis & Structure Fixes (2 hours) ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Root cause analysis
- [x] Fix file structure violations
- [x] Move automation enhancement to folder format
- [x] Create proper folder structure for this initiative
- [x] Move PROPOSAL to artifacts

### Phase 2: Core Workflow Updates (2 hours) - IN PROGRESS

- [ ] Update `/work` workflow with numbering and transparency
- [ ] Update `/implement` workflow with numbering and transparency
- [ ] Update `/plan` workflow with numbering and transparency
- [ ] Add version bump integration to `/commit`
- [ ] Add ADR triggers to `/plan` and `/implement`

### Phase 3: Rules & Documentation (1 hour)

- [ ] Update Section 1.11 (Task System Usage)
  - Add mandatory numbering requirement
  - Add workflow prefix requirement
  - Add transparency requirements
  - Add hierarchical numbering guide
- [ ] Update Section 1.6 (File Operations)
  - Add artifact management rules
  - Add structure decision tree
- [ ] Create Workflow Development Guide

### Phase 4: Remaining Workflows (2-3 hours)

- [ ] Update 14 specialized workflows with same pattern
- [ ] Fix all section numbering inconsistencies
- [ ] Validate cross-references

### Phase 5: Validation & Testing (30 min)

- [ ] Test workflow invocations
- [ ] Verify numbering works correctly
- [ ] Verify transparency shows properly
- [ ] Commit all changes

## Dependencies

- **Scaffolding System:** Must integrate with scaffold.py for future initiatives
- **Task System Integration:** Builds on 2025-10-18 task system work
- **Folder-Based Structure:** Complies with ADR-0013 and 2025-10-18 structure work

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Breaking existing workflows | High | Medium | Test incrementally, commit in batches |
| Numbering logic too complex | Medium | Low | Start simple, provide clear examples |
| Too many announcements (spam) | Low | Medium | Only announce major transitions |
| Forgetting a workflow | Medium | Low | Maintain checklist of all 17 workflows |

## ADRs

**ADR Required:** No - These are corrections to existing standards, not new decisions

**Existing ADRs Applied:**

- ADR-0002: Windsurf Workflow System (workflow structure)
- ADR-0013: Initiative Documentation Standards (folder structure)
