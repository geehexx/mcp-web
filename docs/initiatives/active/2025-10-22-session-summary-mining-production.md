# Initiative: Session Summary Mining Production

## Objective

Enhance session summary mining to production-grade quality through advanced semantic matching, performance optimization, quality metrics, and intelligent workflow automation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Semantic description matching implemented (≥90% accuracy on test set)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established (100+ summaries in <5 minutes)
- [ ] Quality metrics tracking (precision, recall, F1 scores ≥85%)
- [ ] Archive workflow enhanced with automatic blocker resolution
- [ ] Deep dependency update automation (no manual reference fixes)
- [ ] Comprehensive golden test suite (≥95% extraction accuracy)
- [ ] Production deployment documentation complete
- [ ] All enhancements maintain or improve existing test coverage

## Motivation

**Problem:** Current MVP lacks production-grade quality assurance, performance benchmarks, and requires manual blocker updates when archiving initiatives

**Impact:** Without this: manual quality validation, slow processing at scale, manual dependency updates. With this: automated quality tracking, production-ready performance, zero-touch archival workflow

**Value:** Enables truly autonomous session mining and initiative lifecycle management at scale

## Scope

### In Scope

- Advanced semantic matching using embeddings (OpenAI/local models)
- Performance optimization and parallel processing
- Quality metrics dashboard and tracking
- Archive workflow automation enhancements
- LLM-free dependency update system
- Comprehensive benchmarking suite
- Production deployment guide

### Out of Scope

- Real-time monitoring/alerting (separate initiative)
- Web UI for extraction review (separate initiative)
- Multi-language support (English only)
- Integration with external project management tools

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Semantic Matching

- [ ] Research embeddings approaches
- [ ] implement semantic similarity
- [ ] create golden test set
- [ ] benchmark accuracy

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Profile current performance
- [ ] implement parallel processing
- [ ] optimize API calls
- [ ] add benchmarking suite

### Phase 3: Quality Metrics

- [ ] Design metrics tracking
- [ ] implement precision/recall calculations
- [ ] create quality dashboard
- [ ] add logging

### Phase 4: Archive Workflow Enhancement

- [ ] Design blocker auto-resolution
- [ ] implement deep dependency updates
- [ ] add AST-based parsing
- [ ] test edge cases

### Phase 5: Integration & Deployment

- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] write deployment guide
- [ ] update documentation
- [ ] validate with production data

## Blockers

**Current Blockers:**

- None

**Resolved Blockers:**

- None

## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies:**

- [Session Summary Mining - Advanced (completed)](../completed/2025-10-19-session-summary-mining-advanced.md) - Foundation MVP complete, this builds on it
- Phase 1-3 initiatives (sequenced) - Benefit from resource stability, data integrity, performance work

**External Dependencies:**

- OpenAI/Claude API (for embeddings)
- Python libraries: `sentence-transformers`, `faiss-cpu`, `deepeval`

**Prerequisite Initiatives:**

- Session Summary Mining - Advanced (2025-10-19) - ✅ Completed 2025-10-22

**Blocks These Initiatives:**

- None (this initiative is not blocking other work)

## Related Initiatives

- None identified

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Semantic matching accuracy below target (≥90%) | High | Medium | Extensive testing with golden dataset, fallback to file-based heuristics |
| Performance optimization insufficient | Medium | Low | Parallel processing, batch API calls, caching strategies |
| Archive automation complexity high | Medium | Medium | LLM-free approach using AST parsing and regex patterns |
| Quality metrics overhead | Low | Low | Optional tracking, minimal performance impact |

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** Phase 1 (Semantic Matching) + Phase 2 (Performance)
- **Week 3:** Phase 3 (Quality Metrics)
- **Week 4-5:** Phase 4 (Archive Workflow Enhancement)
- **Week 6:** Phase 5 (Integration & Deployment)

## Updates

### 2025-10-22 - Creation

Initiative created from deferred work in Session Summary Mining - Advanced initiative. Extracted enhancements for production-grade quality:

- Advanced semantic matching (embeddings-based)
- Performance optimization and benchmarking
- Quality metrics tracking
- Archive workflow automation (auto-blocker resolution)
- Deep dependency update automation

Sequenced after Phase 1-3 initiatives for maximum benefit. Ready for work.
