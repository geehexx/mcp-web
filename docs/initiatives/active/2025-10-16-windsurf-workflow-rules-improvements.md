**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2025-10-16
**Target Completion:** 2025-10-17
**Owner:** AI Agent
**Priority:** High

---

## Objective

Thoroughly improve Windsurf workflows and rules for consistency, quality, and maintainability by:

1. Standardizing meta-analysis output format for consistency
2. Adding PROJECT_SUMMARY and CHANGELOG maintenance to session-end protocol
3. De-duplicating workflow-specific logic from rules
4. Removing low-value content from workflows
5. Fixing inconsistencies in guidance across workflows and rules

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Meta-analysis workflow produces consistent, comprehensive, LLM-agnostic output
- [ ] PROJECT_SUMMARY.md and CHANGELOG.md maintenance integrated into session-end protocol
- [ ] No workflow-specific implementation details in rules (principles only)
- [ ] Deprecated workflows removed, verbose sections streamlined
- [ ] All workflows follow consistent structure and formatting
- [ ] No conflicting guidance between workflows and rules
- [ ] Documentation reflects all changes

---

## Research Summary

### Key Findings

### 1. Meta-Analysis Inconsistency

- Current format lacks structure compared to consolidate-summaries workflow
- No section length guidance leads to variable output quality
- Not LLM-agnostic (no clear constraints on comprehensiveness vs conciseness)

### 2. Living Documentation Not Maintained

- PROJECT_SUMMARY.md and CHANGELOG.md referenced but not updated regularly
- No requirement in Session End Protocol (00_agent_directives.md)
- Only mentioned in /work workflow Stage 0 as READ operation, not WRITE

### 3. Workflow Logic Duplicated in Rules

- Batch operation examples in 00_agent_directives.md should be in /work workflow
- Session End Protocol details overlap between rules and workflows
- Principles belong in rules, implementation details in workflows

### 4. Low-Value Content

- /fix-date-issues.md is DEPRECATED (dates already fixed)
- /run-tests.md has excessive command examples (could reference Taskfile instead)
- /work has verbose examples that could be condensed

### 5. Inconsistencies

- /work Stage 5 duplicates Session End Protocol from 00_agent_directives.md
- Multiple workflows repeat similar patterns without cross-references
- PROJECT_SUMMARY referenced but not maintained as output

### Best Practices from Research

**From consolidate-summaries workflow:**

- Clear section structure with mandatory fields
- Length guidance per section (min-max ranges)
- LLM-agnostic instructions (work with any model)
- Specific output format requirements

**From Windsurf documentation:**

- Workflows guide through steps, rules provide principles
- Keep workflows under 12,000 characters
- Use structured format (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
- Examples should illustrate, not overwhelm

**From Azure AI Agent Orchestration Patterns:**

- Security: Instrument all operations for observability
- Testing: Design testable interfaces for workflows
- Avoid unnecessary coordination complexity
- Document common pitfalls and anti-patterns

**From LLM Prompt Engineering Best Practices (2025):**

- Use structured output formats (markdown headings)
- Provide clear section length guidance
- Use XML/markdown tags to group related content
- Balance specificity with flexibility

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Meta-Analysis Workflow Improvements (2 hours)

**Goal:** Create consistent, comprehensive meta-analysis output

**Tasks:**

1. **Add structured output template** (based on consolidate-summaries)
   - Mandatory sections with clear purposes
   - Section length guidance (e.g., "Session Scope: 3-5 bullets")
   - LLM-agnostic instructions
   - Quality criteria

2. **Borrow consolidate-summaries patterns:**
   - Section headers with length constraints
   - Mandatory vs optional fields
   - Consistent date/metadata format
   - Output validation checklist

3. **Add quality control guidance:**
   - Minimum comprehensiveness requirements
   - Maximum verbosity limits
   - Checklist for completeness

**File:** `.windsurf/workflows/meta-analysis.md`

**Exit Criteria:**

- Meta-analysis produces structured output matching template
- Section lengths constrained (not too brief, not verbose)
- Output format consistent across different LLMs

### Phase 2: Living Documentation Maintenance (1 hour)

**Goal:** Ensure PROJECT_SUMMARY and CHANGELOG stay current

**Tasks:**

1. **Add to Session End Protocol:**
   - Update 00_agent_directives.md Section 1.8
   - Add step: "Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md if significant changes"
   - Add step: "Update CHANGELOG.md if preparing release"

2. **Add guidance to meta-analysis workflow:**
   - Check if PROJECT_SUMMARY needs updating
   - Trigger: New features, major changes, milestones
   - Format: Follow existing structure

3. **Add to relevant workflows:**
   - /work: Add PROJECT_SUMMARY check at session end
   - /implement: Note when features warrant PROJECT_SUMMARY update
   - /plan: Indicate if planning results should update PROJECT_SUMMARY

**Files:**

- `.windsurf/rules/00_agent_directives.md`
- `.windsurf/workflows/meta-analysis.md`
- `.windsurf/workflows/work.md`

**Exit Criteria:**

- PROJECT_SUMMARY maintenance in Session End Protocol
- Clear triggers for when to update PROJECT_SUMMARY
- CHANGELOG maintenance guidance for releases

### Phase 3: De-Duplicate Rules and Workflows (1.5 hours)

**Goal:** Move implementation details from rules to workflows

**Tasks:**

1. **Refactor 00_agent_directives.md:**
   - Section 1.10 "Operational Efficiency Patterns"
     - Keep: Principle "Use batch operations"
     - Move to /work: Specific examples and code snippets
   - Section 1.8 "Session End Protocol"
     - Keep: High-level requirements
     - Move to /work: Detailed validation steps

2. **Enhance /work workflow:**
   - Add "Efficiency Patterns" section with batch operation examples
   - Move detailed session-end validation from rules
   - Cross-reference rules for principles

3. **Update other workflows:**
   - Remove redundant session-end guidance (defer to /work)
   - Add cross-references where appropriate

**Files:**

- `.windsurf/rules/00_agent_directives.md`
- `.windsurf/workflows/work.md`
- Others as needed

**Exit Criteria:**

- Rules contain only principles, not implementation
- Workflows contain implementation details
- Clear cross-references between rules and workflows
- No duplication of content

### Phase 4: Remove Low-Value Content (1 hour)

**Goal:** Streamline workflows by removing unnecessary content

**Tasks:**

1. **Delete deprecated workflow:**
   - Remove `/fix-date-issues.md` (marked DEPRECATED)
   - Update workflow index if exists

2. **Streamline /run-tests.md:**
   - Reduce command examples (reference Taskfile instead)
   - Keep: Conceptual guidance, parallelization strategy
   - Remove: Excessive example commands (users can check Taskfile)

3. **Condense /work.md:**
   - Identify verbose example sections
   - Consolidate similar examples
   - Keep: Unique patterns, novel approaches
   - Remove: Repetitive illustrations

4. **Standardize formatting:**
   - Consistent reference citation style
   - Uniform code block formatting
   - Standard section naming

**Files:**

- `.windsurf/workflows/fix-date-issues.md` (DELETE)
- `.windsurf/workflows/run-tests.md`
- `.windsurf/workflows/work.md`

**Exit Criteria:**

- No DEPRECATED workflows
- /run-tests under 8,000 characters
- /work more concise (target: <20,000 characters)
- Consistent formatting across all workflows

### Phase 5: Fix Inconsistencies (1 hour)

**Goal:** Ensure consistent guidance across all workflows and rules

**Tasks:**

1. **Audit all workflows for:**
   - Conflicting guidance with rules
   - Outdated cross-references
   - Inconsistent terminology
   - Missing cross-references

2. **Standardize patterns:**
   - Reference citation format
   - Code example format
   - Section naming conventions
   - Frontmatter structure

3. **Update cross-references:**
   - /work ↔ /meta-analysis
   - /implement ↔ /plan
   - Rules ↔ workflows
   - Workflows ↔ documentation

4. **Validate completeness:**
   - All workflows under 12,000 character limit
   - All YAML frontmatter valid
   - All markdown properly formatted
   - All internal links valid

**Files:** All workflows and rules

**Exit Criteria:**

- No conflicting guidance found
- All cross-references valid
- Consistent formatting and terminology
- All workflows pass validation

## Verification Steps

**After each phase:**

1. **Lint check:**

   ```bash
   task docs:lint
   ```

2. **Manual review:**
   - Read updated files for clarity
   - Check cross-references
   - Validate examples

3. **Test workflow execution:**
   - Invoke workflow in Windsurf
   - Verify output matches template
   - Check for errors

**Final validation:**

```bash
# Check workflow character counts
for f in .windsurf/workflows/*.md; do
  wc -c "$f"
done

# Validate no deprecated content
grep -r "DEPRECATED" .windsurf/workflows/

# Check for broken references
grep -r "@\[" .windsurf/ | grep -v ".md:"
```
