## Testing Methodologies

### 1. CLI Testing Patterns

**Source:** [4 Techniques for Testing Python Command-Line (CLI) Apps – Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-cli-testing/)

**Key Insights:**

- Use pytest fixtures + subprocess for CLI tool testing
- Integration test pattern superior to unit mocking for CLI
- Mock external dependencies, test real CLI invocation
- Example pattern:

  ```python
  def test_cli_command(capsys):
      result = subprocess.run(["python", "script.py", "--arg"], capture_output=True)
      assert result.returncode == 0
      assert "expected" in result.stdout.decode()
  ```

**Application:** Phase 1 (Scripts hardening) - CLI integration tests

---

### 2. Legacy Code Testing Strategy

**Source:** [The best way to start testing untested code - Understand Legacy Code](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/best-way-to-start-testing-untested-code/)

**Key Insights:**

- **Outside-in approach:** Start with Approval/Golden Master tests (capture behavior)
- **Inside-out refactoring:** Extract and redesign small chunks
- **Approval Testing:** 4 steps - Arrange, Act, Print, Assert (compare output)
- Faster than writing unit tests from scratch
- Provides safety net for refactoring

**Application:** Phase 1 (Scripts) - Golden Master pattern for 20 untested scripts

---

### 3. Property-Based Testing with Hypothesis

**Source:** [How to Use Hypothesis and Pytest for Robust Property-Based Testing in Python | Pytest with Eric](https://pytest-with-eric.com/pytest-advanced/hypothesis-testing-python/)

**Key Insights:**

- Property-based testing finds 10-30% more edge cases than example-based
- Define properties/invariants, Hypothesis generates test data
- Custom strategies via `@st.composite` for domain types
- Example properties:
  - Reversibility: `reverse(reverse(x)) == x`
  - Idempotency: `f(f(x)) == f(x)`
  - Consistency: `split(join(x)) == x`

**Application:** Phases 4-5 (Property-based testing) - Chunker, validation, text processing

---

### 4. Mutation Testing Comparison

**Source:** [Comparison of Python mutation testing modules – Jakob Breu](https://jakobbr.eu/2021/10/10/comparison-of-python-mutation-testing-modules/)

**Key Insights:**

- **mutmut:** Actively maintained, fast, pytest integration ✅ **RECOMMENDED PRIMARY**
- **cosmic-ray:** Comprehensive mutations, slower, good for deep analysis ✅ **RECOMMENDED QUARTERLY**
- **mutatest:** Unmaintained since 2021 ❌
- **MutPy:** Maintenance concerns, dubious behavior ❌
- Expect 70-85% mutation score for good test suite

**Application:** Phases 2-3 (Mutation testing) - mutmut primary, cosmic-ray quarterly

## Integration Testing

### 5. Python Integration Testing Guide

**Source:** [End-to-End Python Integration Testing: A Complete Guide - LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/learning-hub/python-integration-testing)

**Key Insights:**

- Test from entry point with real components
- Mock only at system boundaries (external APIs, databases)
- Common issues:
  - Tests pass locally, fail in CI/CD (environment differences)
  - Flaky tests due to timing (use explicit waits, not sleep)
  - Database pollution (transactional rollbacks, isolated schemas)
  - Silent failures in async code (strict await checks)
  - Resource leaks (context managers, pytest finalizers)

**Application:** Phase 6 (Integration/E2E) - Workflow validation tests

---

## Performance Testing

### 6. Python Performance Testing

**Source:** [Python Performance Testing: A Tutorial | BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/python-performance-testing)

**Best Practices:**

- Mimic real-time scenarios
- Use profiling before optimizing (cProfile, line_profiler)
- Execute tests in isolated environments
- Automate performance tests in CI/CD
- Use realistic, anonymized production data
- Log metrics regularly (CPU, response time, memory)
- Test under multiple workloads (ramp up/down)

**Application:** Phase 7 (Observability) - Performance metrics dashboard

---

## Pytest Best Practices

### 7. Pytest Fixtures Guide

**Source:** [A Complete Guide to Pytest Fixtures | Better Stack Community](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/testing/pytest-fixtures-guide/)

**Key Insights:**

- **Factory pattern:** Return function that generates data (for multiple instances in one test)
- **conftest.py:** Shared fixtures across test files
- **Fixture scopes:** function (default), module, package, session
- **Parametrize fixtures:** Test multiple configurations with one fixture
- Built-in fixtures: `tmp_path`, `capsys`, `monkeypatch`, `request`

**Application:** All phases - Test infrastructure

---

### 8. Coverage with pytest-cov

**Source:** [How To Measure And Improve Test Coverage With Poetry And Pytest | Pytest with Eric](https://pytest-with-eric.com/coverage/poetry-test-coverage/)

**Key Insights:**

- **Line coverage vs branch coverage:** Branch coverage more comprehensive
- Fail builds below threshold: `--cov-fail-under=90`
- Exclude files: `[tool.coverage.run] omit = ["*/tests/*"]`
- CI integration: GitHub Actions with coverage badges
- Pairing with Hypothesis for property-based coverage

**Application:** All phases - Coverage measurement and enforcement

**Key Insights:**

- pytest can run individually or attached to frameworks (Django, Flask)
- Tag-based test execution (`@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`)
- Comprehensive reporting and debugging

**Key Insights:**

- Code coverage metrics can be misleading
- Mutation testing validates test effectiveness
- cosmic-ray configuration for pytest integration
- Mutation score = (killed mutants) / (total mutants - equivalent)
