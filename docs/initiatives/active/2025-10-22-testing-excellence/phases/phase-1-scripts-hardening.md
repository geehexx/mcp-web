# Phase 1: Scripts & Automation Hardening ⚡

**Duration:** Weeks 1-2 (60-80 hours)
**Priority:** P0 (CRITICAL)
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Objective

Achieve 90%+ coverage on all 24 scripts, prevent automation regressions.

---

## Key Tasks

- [ ] Audit all 24 scripts (categorize by risk, map dependencies)
- [ ] Golden Master test suite (capture current behavior)
- [ ] CLI integration tests (subprocess + mocks pattern)
- [ ] Deep dive on critical scripts (validate_initiatives.py, dependency_registry.py, extract_action_items.py)
- [ ] CI integration (pytest discovery, pre-commit hooks, 90% coverage enforcement)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 90%+ line coverage on `scripts/`
- [ ] Zero untested CLI entry points
- [ ] Golden Master suite for all validators
- [ ] CI fails on script changes without tests

---

## Progress

### 2025-10-22

#### Checkpoint 1: Import Fixes (Session 1)

- ✅ Fixed 8 test files after Phase 0 reorganization
- ✅ 139/152 tests passing (91.4% pass rate)
- ✅ Commit `2a2219b` delivered
- ⏭️ 13 scaffold test failures documented (template path issues from Phase 0)

**Status:** Checkpoint delivered. Import errors resolved.

#### Checkpoint 2: Additional Test Fixes (Session 2)

- ✅ Fixed 34 inline import errors in validation tests (`test_validate_references.py`, `test_validate_task_format.py`)
- ✅ Fixed 22 AsyncMock usage errors in `test_browser_pool.py`
- ✅ 317/318 tests passing (99.7% pass rate)
- ✅ Commit `26a6cb6` delivered
- ⏭️ 1 scaffold template failure remaining (from Phase 0)

**Status:** Import/mock cleanup complete. Ready for Phase 1 core work (Golden Master tests, coverage push).

#### Checkpoint 3: Phase 1B Coverage Tests (Session 3)

- ✅ Fixed 4 failing tests in scripts suite (validate_workflows, analysis_scripts, file_ops)
- ✅ Added 16 comprehensive edge case tests for `validate_initiatives.py` and `extract_action_items.py`
- ✅ 37/38 new tests passing (97% pass rate on new tests)
- ✅ All 99/99 tests in `tests/scripts/` passing
- ✅ Commits: `fd7ea74` (test fixes) + `6f41958` (Phase 1B coverage tests)
- 📊 Coverage baseline captured: `extract_action_items.py` 27%, `validate_initiatives.py` 45%
- ⏭️ Phase 1B partially complete - added utility function tests; complex LLM mocking deferred to future work

**Status:** Test foundation solid. Coverage improved from 27%/44% baseline with focus on testable utility functions. LLM integration and deep validation logic require dedicated session with complex mocking patterns.
