# Phase 5: Property-Based Testing - Advanced ðŸ”¬

**Duration:** Week 7 (30-40 hours)
**Priority:** P2 (MEDIUM)
**Status:** Not Started

---

## Objective

Extend property-based testing to validation and generation scripts.

- [ ] Index generation properties (determinism, completeness)
- [ ] Dependency registry properties (consistency, cycles)
- [ ] Complex workflow properties (idempotency, commutativity)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 10+ additional Hypothesis tests
- [ ] Validation scripts have property-based tests
- [ ] 5+ new edge cases discovered
