# Initiative: Performance Optimization Pipeline

**Created:** 2025-10-15
**Owner:** AI Agent
**Status:** Active - Phase 1 Complete, Planning Phase 2
**Priority:** High
**Target:** Achieve <5 second summarization without quality compromise

---

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive performance optimization initiative to profile, benchmark, and optimize the entire mcp-web pipeline with focus on reducing summarization latency from current baseline to well under 5 seconds while maintaining or improving quality.

### Key Goals

1. **Profiling & Monitoring**: Build reusable profiling tools and comprehensive monitoring
2. **Baseline Metrics**: Establish current performance baselines across all components
3. **Optimization Phases**: Implement optimizations in 3 phased approaches
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure zero quality regression through golden tests
5. **Future-Proof**: Create extensible framework for continuous optimization

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Summarization completes in <5 seconds for typical web pages (5-10k tokens)
- ✅ 90%+ quality retention vs baseline (measured via golden tests)
- ✅ Comprehensive profiling tools for ongoing monitoring
- ✅ Scalable to 10x current workload
- ✅ Cost reduction through batch processing where applicable
