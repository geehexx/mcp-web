# Phase 2: Advanced Optimizations

**Status:** ðŸ”„ Planned
**Duration:** 4-6 weeks (estimated)
**Owner:** AI Agent
**Target:** Q4 2025

---

## Objective

Implement architectural optimizations for caching, streaming, and adaptive strategies to achieve <5 second target.

---

## Planned Optimizations

### 1. Multi-Level Caching (High Priority)

**Goal:** Reduce redundant LLM calls through intelligent caching

**Implementation:**

- Content-based cache keys (hash of extracted text)
- Redis/in-memory caching layer
- TTL-based expiration (configurable)
- Cache hit metrics and monitoring

**Expected Impact:** 30-50% latency reduction for repeated content

### 2. Streaming Implementation (High Priority)

**Goal:** Improve perceived latency with streaming responses

**Implementation:**

- Stream tokens as they're generated
- Progressive UI updates
- TTFT (Time To First Token) optimization
- Streaming for both map and reduce phases

**Expected Impact:** 2-3x improvement in perceived latency

### 3. Hybrid Chunking Improvements (Medium Priority)

**Goal:** Optimize chunk boundaries for better context preservation

**Implementation:**

- Semantic boundary detection
- Cross-chunk context windows
- Dynamic chunk sizing based on content type
- Overlap optimization

**Expected Impact:** 10-20% quality improvement, 5-10% speed improvement

### 4. Content-Aware Routing (Medium Priority)

**Goal:** Route to optimal strategy based on content characteristics

**Implementation:**

- Small content (<2k tokens): Direct summarization
- Medium content (2-10k): Optimized map-reduce
- Large content (>10k): Hierarchical map-reduce
- Dynamic strategy selection

**Expected Impact:** 20-30% average latency reduction

### 5. Batch Processing Mode (Low Priority)

**Goal:** 50% cost reduction for non-real-time workloads

**Implementation:**

- Batch API integration (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Queue-based processing
- 24-hour processing window
- Background job management

**Expected Impact:** 50% cost reduction for batch workloads

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Achieve <5 second summarization for typical pages
- [ ] Cache hit rate >30% in production
- [ ] TTFT <1 second with streaming
- [ ] Quality retention â‰¥90% vs baseline
- [ ] Support 10x concurrent workload

---

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 infrastructure (profiling, benchmarking)
- Redis or in-memory cache implementation
- Streaming protocol implementation
- ADR for caching strategy

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Cache invalidation complexity | Start with simple TTL, iterate |
| Streaming adds complexity | Implement progressively, maintain fallback |
| Quality regression | Extensive golden test coverage |
| Increased memory usage | Monitor and optimize cache size |

---

## Timeline

- Week 1-2: Multi-level caching implementation
- Week 3-4: Streaming implementation
- Week 5: Hybrid chunking improvements
- Week 6: Content-aware routing and validation

---

## Next Steps

1. Create ADR for caching strategy
2. Design cache key schema
3. Implement caching layer with tests
4. Benchmark cache performance
5. Implement streaming support
