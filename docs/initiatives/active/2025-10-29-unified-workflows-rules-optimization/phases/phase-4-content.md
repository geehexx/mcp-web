# Phase 4: Content Optimization

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Core Team
**Duration:** ~1.5 hours
**Priority:** P1 (High)

---

## Objective

Streamline workflow and rule bodies by removing redundant sections, consolidating boilerplate context, and ensuring each document delivers high-value guidance with minimal tokens.

---

## Key Tasks

- [ ] Remove `## Command Metadata` / `## Rule Metadata` sections and similar redundant blocks identified in Phase 1
- [ ] Replace repetitive context-loading paragraphs with concise references to `/rules/` directory guidance
- [ ] Consolidate or relocate low-value sections (e.g., generic integration or anti-patterns) into centralized documentation where appropriate
- [ ] Ensure remaining sections follow consistent, concise structure (Objective, Prerequisites, Steps, Validation, etc.)
- [ ] Record token savings per file and aggregate results in `artifacts/token-inventory.md`
- [ ] Update `artifacts/metadata-removal-playbook.md` with actual removals and lessons learned

---

## Deliverables

- Updated `.unified/` content with redundant sections removed
- Token savings report reflecting content optimizations
- Playbook documenting adjustments and reusable patterns

---

## Entry Criteria

- Phase 3 frontmatter optimization complete
- Metadata removal candidates validated and approved
- Baseline content snapshots captured for comparison

---

## Exit Criteria

- All targeted sections removed or refactored without losing essential guidance
- Token savings documented and â‰¥50% of total target achieved through content work
- No workflows/rules regress in clarity; peer review or self-audit recorded in artifacts

---

## Notes

- Maintain security-first language; do not remove warnings or safeguards that enforce OWASP LLM Top 10 principles
- Use initiative artifact structure to store before/after excerpts if helpful for future audits
- Coordinate with documentation maintainers to centralize repeated guidance where applicable
