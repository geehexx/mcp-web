# Phase 6: Documentation & Rollout

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Core Team
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Priority:** P1 (High)

---

## Objective

Finalize initiative deliverables: update documentation, communicate changes, run final validation suite, and prepare for handoff/monitoring after merge.

---

## Key Tasks

- [ ] Update `.unified/README.md` with minimal schema guidance, examples, and validation expectations
- [ ] Refresh related guides (e.g., workflow development, IDE compatibility) to reflect new structure
- [ ] Document rollout checklist in `artifacts/validation-checklist.md` and ensure all gates are green
- [ ] Run full regression suite (`task lint`, `uv run mypy`, `uv run pytest -n auto`, security scans) post-optimization and record results
- [ ] Regenerate `.cursor/` and `.windsurf/` artifacts, verify zero diffs after rerun, and document in initiative updates
- [ ] Communicate changes via initiative update, PROJECT_SUMMARY.md entry, and notify stakeholders (e.g., PR summary)

## Checkpoints & Cadence

| ID | Trigger | Required Actions |
|----|---------|------------------|
| C6.1 | Documentation refreshed | Commit updates to `.unified/README.md` and related guides; annotate this phase with summary; push branch |
| C6.2 | Rollout checklist verified | Update `artifacts/validation-checklist.md` with final gate status; run `/commit` workflow |
| C6.3 | Final validation suite executed | Attach command logs (lint, mypy, pytest, bandit, semgrep) and regenerated artifact diff results; update initiative "Updates" with go/no-go decision |
| C6.4 | PR prepared | Draft PR with required template, attach artifacts references, gather preliminary reviewer list |

Advance to Phase 7 after C6.4 when PR is ready for review and all evidence is linked.

---

## Deliverables

- Updated documentation reflecting minimal schema and streamlined workflows
- Rollout checklist with validation evidence
- Initiative update summarizing completion and next steps

---

## Entry Criteria

- Tooling/validation updates from Phase 5 merged in feature branch
- Content and frontmatter refactors stable (no known regressions)
- Baseline metrics confirming token reduction ready for comparison

---

## Exit Criteria

- Documentation PR submitted/merged with updated guidance
- Final validation suite documented and successful
- Stakeholders notified of changes; monitoring plan recorded if follow-up needed

---

## Notes

- Coordinate with Testing Excellence initiative for integrated validation reporting where overlaps exist
- Capture before/after metrics succinctly for communication materials
- If additional follow-up tasks emerge (e.g., automation enhancements), log them in backlog with clear ownership
- Ensure PR draft references initiative checkpoints and includes links to artifacts, ADR, constitution updates, and validation logs
