# Token Inventory

Track baseline and post-optimization token metrics for unified workflows and rules. Approximate 1 token â‰ˆ 4 characters unless otherwise noted.

## Baseline (Pre-Optimization)

| File | Type | Characters | Approx Tokens | Notes |
|------|------|------------|---------------|-------|
| _TBD_ | _rule/workflow_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | Collect during Phase 0 |

### Aggregated Metrics

- **Total characters:** _TBD_
- **Approx tokens:** _TBD_
- **Average tokens per file:** _TBD_
- **Top 5 heaviest files:** _TBD_

## Post-Optimization

| File | Type | Characters | Approx Tokens | Delta vs Baseline |
|------|------|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| _TBD_ | _rule/workflow_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |

### Aggregated Metrics

- **Total characters:** _TBD_
- **Approx tokens:** _TBD_
- **Average tokens per file:** _TBD_
- **Total savings:** _TBD_

## Measurement Notes

- Capture measurements via scripted char counts (`wc -c`) and divide by 4 for token approximation.
- Document any files measured with precise tokenizer tooling (e.g., tiktoken) separately.
- Update this artifact after each major phase (inventory, frontmatter, content) to track progress.
