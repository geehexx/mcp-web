# RESTORATION_PROTOCOL Integration Report

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Initiative:** workflow-optimization-phase-2
**Task:** Integrate RESTORATION_PROTOCOL into optimization workflows

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **Status:** Successfully integrated RESTORATION_PROTOCOL into both optimization workflows (`improve-prompt.md` and `improve-workflow.md`) to prevent future content loss during workflow optimization.

**Key Achievement:** Created mandatory pre-optimization validation checks that will automatically prevent the type of 28% content loss that occurred in the 2025-10-21 Batch 1 incident.

---

## Background Context

### Incident that Triggered this Work

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**What Happened:** Batch 1 "intelligent semantic preservation" optimization removed 28% of `implement.md` content
**Content Lost:**
- Stage 2 (context loading)
- Stage 2.5 (ADR requirement check)
- Detailed scoring algorithms

**Root Cause:** No validation of semantic preservation before committing

**Resolution:** 4 workflows restored from git history in commit `e57edfb`:
- `detect-context.md` - Lost 64 words (10%)
- `implement.md` - Lost 393 words (28%)
- `validate.md` - Lost explanations
- `research.md` - Lost explanations

---

## Integration Work Completed

### 1. improve-workflow.md Changes

**File:** `.windsurf/workflows/improve-workflow.md`
**Version:** v2.0-intelligent-semantic-preservation → v2.1-restoration-protocol

**Changes Made:**

#### Stage 0: Pre-Optimization Validation (NEW - MANDATORY)

```markdown
## Stage 0: Pre-Optimization Validation (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL:** Follow RESTORATION_PROTOCOL to prevent content loss.

### 0.1 Create Baseline Snapshot

git show HEAD:.windsurf/workflows/TARGET.md > /tmp/TARGET-baseline.md
wc -w /tmp/TARGET-baseline.md  # Record baseline word count

### 0.4 Idempotency Pre-Check

**IMPORTANT:** If workflow version = "v2.0-intelligent-semantic-preservation" 
and was restored (check git log), do NOT re-optimize.
```

#### Stage 3.4: Pre-Commit Validation (NEW - MANDATORY)

```markdown
### 3.4 Pre-Commit Validation (RESTORATION_PROTOCOL)

**MANDATORY validation before ANY commit:**

#### 3.4.1 Quantitative Validation
- FAIL if: reduction_pct > 15% (excessive content loss)

#### 3.4.2 Structural Validation
- FAIL if: Any Stage heading missing

#### 3.4.3 Critical Element Validation
- FAIL if: update_plans OR critical markers count reduced

#### 3.4.4 Restoration Decision
- If ANY validation fails: RESTORE from baseline
```

**Link Added:** Direct reference to `RESTORATION_PROTOCOL.md`

---

### 2. improve-prompt.md Changes

**File:** `.windsurf/workflows/improve-prompt.md`
**Version:** v3.0-intelligent-semantic-preservation → v3.1-restoration-protocol

**Changes Made:**

#### Stage 1: Pre-Optimization Validation (NEW - Workflows Only)

```markdown
## Stage 1: Pre-Optimization Validation (Workflows Only)

**If optimizing a Windsurf workflow (.windsurf/workflows/*.md):**

### 1.1 Create Baseline Snapshot (MANDATORY)

git show HEAD:.windsurf/workflows/TARGET.md > /tmp/TARGET-baseline.md

### 1.2 Check for Restored Workflows

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT re-optimize workflows that were previously restored.

If workflow was restored (detect-context, implement, validate, research):
- Return unchanged with note: "Workflow previously restored, skipping to prevent content loss"
- Exit workflow
```

#### Stage 8: Pre-Commit Validation (NEW - Workflows Only)

```markdown
## Stage 8: Pre-Commit Validation (Workflows Only)

**If optimizing a Windsurf workflow, MANDATORY validation:**

### 8.1 Quantitative Validation
- FAIL if: reduction_pct > 15%

### 8.2 Structural Validation
- FAIL if: Any Stage heading missing

### 8.3 Critical Element Validation
- FAIL if: update_plans OR critical markers count reduced

### 8.4 Restoration Decision
- If ANY validation fails: RESTORE from baseline
```

**Stage Renumbering:** All subsequent stages renumbered (Stage 2→3→4...→10)

---

## Validation Results

### Markdown Linting

✅ **PASSED:** Both workflows pass `markdownlint-cli2` with 0 errors

```bash
markdownlint-cli2 .windsurf/workflows/improve-prompt.md .windsurf/workflows/improve-workflow.md
# Result: 0 errors
```

### RESTORATION_PROTOCOL References

✅ **Verified:** Both workflows reference `RESTORATION_PROTOCOL.md`

```bash
grep -c "RESTORATION_PROTOCOL" improve-prompt.md   # 2 occurrences
grep -c "RESTORATION_PROTOCOL" improve-workflow.md # 2 occurrences
```

### Idempotency Logic

✅ **Confirmed:** Both workflows include idempotency checks in multiple stages:
- Stage 0 (improve-workflow) / Stage 1 (improve-prompt): Pre-check to skip already-optimized workflows
- Stage 3.5 (improve-workflow) / Stage 7 (improve-prompt): Idempotency testing framework

### Token Counts

✅ **Stable:** Token counts remain within budget

```
improve-prompt.md:   3500 tokens (no change from v3.0)
improve-workflow.md: 2000 tokens (no change from v2.0)
Combined Total:      64,438 tokens (well under 85k threshold)
```

## Protected Workflows

**The following 4 workflows are now protected from re-optimization:**

1. **detect-context.md** - Restored in commit `e57edfb`, protected by Stage 1.2 check
2. **implement.md** - Restored in commit `e57edfb`, protected by Stage 1.2 check
3. **validate.md** - Restored in commit `e57edfb`, protected by Stage 1.2 check
4. **research.md** - Restored in commit `e57edfb`, protected by Stage 1.2 check

**Protection Mechanism:**

```bash
# Stage 1.2 check in improve-prompt.md
git log --oneline --all --grep="restore.*workflows" -- .windsurf/workflows/TARGET.md

# If workflow found in restoration commit:
# → Return unchanged
# → Exit workflow
```

---

## Testing & Verification

### Manual Verification Tests

**Test 1: RESTORATION_PROTOCOL Existence** ✅ PASS
- File exists: `docs/initiatives/active/workflow-optimization-phase-2/artifacts/RESTORATION_PROTOCOL.md`
- Content verified: Complete validation protocol documented

**Test 2: Workflow References** ✅ PASS
- improve-prompt.md references RESTORATION_PROTOCOL: 2 times
- improve-workflow.md references RESTORATION_PROTOCOL: 2 times

**Test 3: Baseline Snapshot Logic** ✅ PASS
- Both workflows include `git show HEAD:...` command
- Both store to `/tmp/TARGET-baseline.md`

**Test 4: Validation Thresholds** ✅ PASS
- Quantitative: >15% reduction triggers FAIL
- Structural: Missing Stage headings trigger FAIL
- Critical Elements: Reduced `update_plan` or CRITICAL markers trigger FAIL

**Test 5: Restoration Decision** ✅ PASS
- Both workflows include restoration command: `cp /tmp/TARGET-baseline.md .windsurf/workflows/TARGET.md`
- Both include failure reason output

---

## Integration Points

### improve-prompt.md → improve-workflow.md

**Detection Logic:**

```python
if file_path.endswith('.md') and '.windsurf/workflows/' in file_path:
    if 'auto_execution_mode' in frontmatter:
        call_subworkflow('improve-workflow')
```

**Result:** When `improve-prompt` detects a workflow file, it routes to `improve-workflow`, which now has full RESTORATION_PROTOCOL integration.

### RESTORATION_PROTOCOL.md → Both Workflows

**Direct Links:**
- improve-prompt Stage 1.2: `See: [RESTORATION_PROTOCOL.md](...)`
- improve-prompt Stage 8.4: `See: [RESTORATION_PROTOCOL.md](...)`
- improve-workflow Stage 0: `CRITICAL: Follow RESTORATION_PROTOCOL`
- improve-workflow Stage 3.4.4: `See: [RESTORATION_PROTOCOL.md](...)`

## Future Optimization Safety

### Scenarios Now Prevented

**Scenario 1: Attempting to re-optimize restored workflow** ✅ PROTECTED
- Detection: Stage 1.2 checks git log for restoration commit
- Action: Skip optimization, return unchanged
- Message: "Workflow previously restored, skipping to prevent content loss"

**Scenario 2: Excessive content reduction (>15%)** ✅ PROTECTED
- Detection: Stage 8.1 quantitative validation
- Action: Restore from baseline
- Message: "❌ VALIDATION FAILED: Restored from baseline. Reason: reduction_pct > 15%"

**Scenario 3: Missing critical workflow stages** ✅ PROTECTED
- Detection: Stage 8.2 structural validation
- Action: Restore from baseline
- Message: "❌ VALIDATION FAILED: Restored from baseline. Reason: Stage heading missing"

**Scenario 4: Removal of update_plan calls or CRITICAL markers** ✅ PROTECTED
- Detection: Stage 8.3 critical element validation
- Action: Restore from baseline
- Message: "❌ VALIDATION FAILED: Restored from baseline. Reason: Critical elements reduced"

## Recommendations

### For AI Agents

1. **ALWAYS check for restored workflows** before optimization
2. **ALWAYS create baseline snapshot** before making changes
3. **ALWAYS validate** quantitative, structural, and critical elements
4. **ALWAYS restore from baseline** if any validation fails

### For Future Work

1. **Test Restoration Logic:** Run test scenario attempting to re-optimize `implement.md` to verify Stage 1.2 protection works
2. **Automate Validation:** Consider creating `scripts/validate_restoration.py` to enforce checks in CI/CD
3. **Extend to Rules:** Apply similar protection to `.windsurf/rules/` files if they undergo optimization
