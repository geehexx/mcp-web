## Core Principles

### 1. Semantic Preservation Over Token Reduction

**From Microsoft Research LLMLingua:**
> "LLMLingua maintains the original reasoning, summarization, and dialogue capabilities of the prompt, even at a maximum compression ratio of 20x... preserving key semantic information, especially in logical reasoning details."

**Application to Workflows:**
- **Preserve:** Decision logic, workflow-specific instructions, critical examples
- **Compress:** Redundant explanations, verbose stage markers, duplicate patterns
- **Never lose:** Domain knowledge, unique guidance, actionable instructions

### 2. Cognitive Load Management

**From Cognitive Load Theory (2024):**

**Three types of cognitive load:**
1. **Intrinsic Load:** Inherent complexity of the task (PRESERVE)
2. **Extraneous Load:** Unnecessary cognitive effort from poor presentation (ELIMINATE)
3. **Germane Load:** Effort to build mental schemas (OPTIMIZE)

**Apply to workflow optimization:**
- **Intrinsic:** Keep complex workflows detailed (detect-context, work, validate)
- **Extraneous:** Remove verbose announcements, redundant stage markers
- **Germane:** Preserve examples that build understanding, remove redundant ones

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

**Keep layered information:**
1. **Overview:** High-level purpose and philosophy (preserve)
2. **Quick-Start:** Essential steps for simple use cases (preserve)
3. **Detailed:** Complex scenarios and edge cases (selective compression)
4. **Advanced:** Optimization patterns and variations (compress or externalize)

## Research-Backed Techniques

### Technique 1: Chunking Information

**Principle:** Break complex information into manageable chunks

**Apply:**
- ✅ **Keep:** Task plan granularity for complex workflows (>10 steps)
- ✅ **Compress:** Merge simple sequential steps in straightforward workflows
- ❌ **Don't:** Collapse all task plans to 4 generic steps

**Example:**

```markdown
<!-- GOOD: Appropriate chunking for complex workflow -->
plan: [
  { step: "1. Research - Define scope", status: "pending" },
  { step: "  1.1. Identify tech/security/performance needs", status: "pending" },
  { step: "  1.2. Document research questions", status: "pending" },
  { step: "2. Research - Internal patterns", status: "pending" },
  { step: "  2.1. Search codebase", status: "pending" },
  { step: "  2.2. Review ADRs", status: "pending" },
  // ...
]

<!-- BAD: Over-compressed loses progress visibility -->
plan: [
  { step: "1. Research - Define scope and search internal", status: "pending" },
  { step: "2. Research - Perform web research", status: "pending" },
  // Lost: Individual progress tracking, debugging clarity
]
```

### Technique 2: Example Sufficiency

**Principle:** Use 2-3 concrete examples to illustrate concepts, not 8-10

**From research:**
> "Provide concrete examples and analogies to illustrate complex concepts"

**Apply:**
- ✅ **Keep:** Workflow-specific examples (auth patterns in security workflows)
- ✅ **Keep:** Examples showing edge cases or common mistakes
- ❌ **Remove:** Redundant variations of the same concept
- ❌ **Don't:** Replace with generic placeholders like "relevant|pattern"

**Example:**

```markdown
<!-- GOOD: Specific, illustrative examples -->
```bash
# Search for authentication patterns
grep_search("auth|authentication|api.?key", "src/", includes=["*.py"])

# Search for security implementations  
grep_search("hash|encrypt|bcrypt|argon2", "src/", includes=["*.py"])
```

<!-- BAD: Generic placeholder loses instructional value -->
```bash
grep_search("relevant|pattern", "src/", includes=["*.py"])
```
```

### Technique 3: Progressive Disclosure in Documentation

**Principle:** Layer information from essential to detailed

**Apply:**
- ✅ **Keep:** Stage markers for multi-phase workflows (clarity for long-running)
- ✅ **Simplify:** Stage announcements (remove verbose "Entering Stage X" if obvious)
- ✅ **Preserve:** Stage completion markers if workflow has validation checkpoints
- ❌ **Don't:** Remove all structure in complex workflows

**Example:**

```markdown
<!-- GOOD: Preserved structure for complex workflow -->
## Stage 1: Define Research Scope

### Identify What to Research
- Technology specifics
- Security considerations
- Performance implications

**Update plan after completion:**
update_plan({ explanation: "Scope defined", ... })

<!-- ACCEPTABLE: Simplified for straightforward workflow -->
## Stage 1: Define Scope
Identify: technology, security, performance needs.
```

### Technique 4: Information Density Optimization

**Principle:** Balance comprehensiveness with digestibility

**From research:**
> "Use pyramid structure: Start with most important information and progressively add details"

**Apply:**
- ✅ **Tables:** For structured data with 3+ similar items (decision matrices, config options)
- ✅ **Bullets:** For lists of steps or options
- ✅ **Prose:** For narrative flow, complex logic, decision explanations
- ❌ **Don't:** Tablify everything including narrative decision logic

**Example:**

```markdown
<!-- GOOD: Table for structured decision matrix -->
| Scenario | ADR Required? | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| New dependency | ✅ Yes | Call `/new-adr` |
| Security decision | ✅ Yes | Call `/new-adr` |
| Algorithm choice | ❌ No | Document in code |

<!-- GOOD: Prose for complex decision logic -->
When multiple initiatives are equally active AND both require attention:
1. Check user explicit mention (highest priority)
2. Compare last-modified dates
3. If recent (< 24h), route to most recent
4. If both old, prompt user for choice

This ensures agent doesn't make arbitrary decisions when context is ambiguous.

<!-- BAD: Tablifying loses decision rationale -->
| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Multiple active | Check dates |
| Recent | Route recent |
| Old | Prompt |
```

### Technique 5: Consistent Structure Maintenance

**Principle:** Maintain consistent format to reduce extraneous cognitive load

**From research:**
> "Maintain a consistent structure and format throughout the documentation"

**Apply:**
- ✅ **Keep:** Standard workflow structure (Purpose, Invocation, Philosophy, Stages)
- ✅ **Keep:** Task plan format across all workflows
- ✅ **Keep:** update_plan() pattern for workflow control
- ❌ **Don't:** Vary structure arbitrarily between workflows

## Differential Optimization Strategy

### Complexity-Based Classification

| Workflow Type | Complexity | Optimization Approach | Example |
|---------------|------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Simple Linear** | 20-40 | Aggressive compression (30-40%) | new-adr, bump-version |
| **Moderate Branching** | 40-60 | Balanced optimization (20-30%) | commit, update-docs |
| **Complex Multi-Stage** | 60-80 | Conservative preservation (10-20%) | research, validate, generate-plan |
| **Critical Orchestrators** | 80-100 | Minimal changes (5-10%) | work, detect-context, implement |

### Runtime-Based Preservation

| Runtime | Progress Tracking | Optimization |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| <2 min | Simple (initial plan only) | Aggressive |
| 2-10 min | Moderate (stage markers) | Balanced |
| >10 min | Detailed (granular updates) | Conservative |

## Quality Validation Framework

### Pre-Optimization Checklist

Before optimizing ANY workflow:

- [ ] Classify complexity (20-100 scale)
- [ ] Estimate typical runtime (<2min, 2-10min, >10min)
- [ ] Identify workflow-specific instructions (preserve these)
- [ ] Count decision points (if >5, preserve structure)
- [ ] List unique examples (keep 2-3 best)

### Post-Optimization Validation

After optimizing:

- [ ] **Semantic preservation:** All decision logic intact?
- [ ] **Instruction clarity:** Still actionable without ambiguity?
- [ ] **Example sufficiency:** 2-3 concrete examples per concept?
- [ ] **Progress visibility:** Adequate for complexity/runtime?
- [ ] **No placeholders:** No "relevant|pattern" generic replacements?
- [ ] **Domain knowledge:** Workflow-specific guidance preserved?

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Token reduction | 15-30% variance | All workflows same % |
| Instruction clarity | 8/10+ | Lost specific guidance |
| Example count | 2-3 per concept | 0-1 or generic placeholders |
| Decision logic | 100% preserved | Any lost branch |
| Task granularity | Matched to complexity | All collapsed to 4 steps |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Mechanical Formula Application

**Wrong:**
```
FOR each workflow:
  Remove "Stage 0"
  Collapse task plan to 4 steps
  Remove all examples except 1
  Convert all prose to tables
  Remove all update_plan() calls
```

**Result:** Identical reduction percentages, lost context

### ❌ Generic Placeholder Substitution

**Wrong:**
```markdown
<!-- Before -->
grep_search("auth|authentication|api.?key", "src/", includes=["*.py"])

<!-- After - TOO GENERIC -->
grep_search("search_term", "directory", includes=["*.ext"])
```

**Result:** Lost instructional specificity

### ❌ Over-Tablification

**Wrong:** Converting narrative decision logic to tables loses rationale

**Keep prose for:**
- Complex conditional logic with rationale
- Workflow philosophy and principles
- Edge case explanations
- Sequential decision trees

### ❌ Complete Structure Removal

**Wrong:** Removing ALL stage markers, progress updates, completion announcements

**Result:** No visibility during long-running workflows, harder debugging

## Recommended Optimization Process

### Step 1: Analyze Workflow (5-10 min)

1. Read entire workflow end-to-end
2. Classify complexity (20-100)
3. Identify unique vs common content
4. Mark preservation zones (decision logic, unique examples)
5. Mark compression zones (verbose descriptions, redundant examples)

### Step 2: Apply Targeted Techniques (10-20 min)

1. **Duplication elimination:** Remove true duplicates across workflows
2. **Example consolidation:** Keep 2-3 best, remove redundant
3. **Table consolidation:** For structured data only
4. **Stage simplification:** Remove verbose markers, keep structure
5. **Progress optimization:** Match granularity to complexity

### Step 3: Validate Quality (5-10 min)

1. Run post-optimization checklist
2. Compare before/after diffs
3. Verify no lost decision logic
4. Check example sufficiency
5. Test instruction actionability (can you follow it?)

### Step 4: Measure and Learn (5 min)

1. Calculate token reduction percentage
2. If outside 15-30% range, investigate why
3. Document what worked well
4. Document what didn't
5. Update methodology with learnings
