# Phase 0: Discovery & Research üîç

**Status:** Completed (2025-10-22)
**Owner:** @ai-agent
**Duration:** 1 week
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)

## Objective

Consolidate Windsurf and Cursor research, evaluate repository impact, and produce foundational artifacts (initiative, research dossier, Cursor handoff) that guide the remaining phases.

## Key Tasks

- [x] Audit `.windsurf/rules/` and `.windsurf/workflows/` (triggers, structure, dependencies)
- [x] Research Cursor `.mdc` rules, commands, trigger model, validation tooling
- [x] Compare architectures and identify transformation gaps (`model_decision`, workflows)
- [x] Document findings in `artifacts/research.md`
- [x] Produce `CURSOR_AGENT_HANDOFF.md` with implementation guidance
- [x] Draft initiative plan and phase breakdown

## Deliverables

- `/docs/initiatives/active/2025-10-22-cursor-windsurf-dual-compatibility/artifacts/research.md`
- `/CURSOR_AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
- Initiative plan (this directory)

## Exit Criteria

- Research artifact reviewed
- Initiative accepted by project owner
- Cursor handoff ready for implementation agent
