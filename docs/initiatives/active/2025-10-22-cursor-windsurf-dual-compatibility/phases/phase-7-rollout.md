**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Release Engineering
**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Priority:** P1 (High)

## Objective

Deploy the dual-IDE system, manage the change rollout, and establish monitoring/feedback loops to ensure stability after launch.

## Key Tasks

- [ ] Stage rollout plan (pilot with core maintainers, expand to full team)
- [ ] Coordinate with CI owners to merge validation pipelines
- [ ] Monitor initial adoption metrics (build times, failure rates, support tickets)
- [ ] Host knowledge transfer sessions / office hours for contributors
- [ ] Capture feedback and triage issues into backlog (Phase 8 if needed)
- [ ] Define long-term ownership and maintenance model
- [ ] Update initiative progress and close-out report

## Deliverables

- Rollout schedule and communication plan
- Monitoring dashboard/report capturing metrics described in initiative
- Lessons-learned and maintenance playbook

## Exit Criteria

- Dual-IDE pipeline adopted by majority of contributors
- Monitoring indicates stable operation with no major regressions
- Initiative success criteria met, initiative ready to transition to monitoring or closure
