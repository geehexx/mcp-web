# Initiative: Phase 0 - Security Hardening

## Deployment Blocker - Must Complete Before Production Release

---

## Objective

Eliminate P0 security vulnerabilities to achieve minimal security posture required for production deployment, focusing on prompt injection prevention, authentication implementation, and comprehensive security testing.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Prompt injection detection system implemented (≥90% detection rate)
- [ ] Content sanitization framework with comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Authentication middleware implemented (API key minimum, OAuth optional)
- [ ] Zero RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerabilities in security scans
- [ ] Security test suite passing in CI (OWASP LLM Top 10 coverage)
- [ ] Threat model documented
- [ ] SECURITY.md created for responsible disclosure
- [ ] All security findings from Bandit/Semgrep addressed

---

## Motivation

**Problem:**

Current mcp-web implementation lacks critical security controls for production deployment:

1. **Prompt Injection (OWASP LLM-01)**: Scraped web content flows directly to LLM without sanitization, enabling trivial prompt injection attacks
2. **Missing Authentication**: No authentication/authorization controls allow unrestricted access to MCP tools
3. **Security Testing Gap**: No comprehensive security test suite for LLM-specific vulnerabilities

**Impact:**

- **Without this:** Deployment risk is unacceptable - easy data exfiltration via prompt injection
- **With this:** Minimal viable security posture for controlled production deployment
- **Blockers:** This initiative gates all deployment decisions

**Value:**

- **Security:** Prevent prompt injection, unauthorized access, data exfiltration
- **Compliance:** Meet OWASP LLM Top 10 requirements
- **Trust:** Enable confident deployment to users

## Blockers

**Current Blockers:**

None - this is the highest priority initiative.

**Potential Blockers:**

- **ML Model for Injection Detection** - May defer to pattern-based if model training complex
- **OAuth 2.1 Implementation** - Deferred to optional, API key sufficient

---

## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies:**

None - this is a foundational security initiative.

**External Dependencies:**

- **Python Libraries**: garak (fuzzing), bandit (security scanning), semgrep (linting)
- **OWASP Resources**: LLM Top 10 documentation, test case examples

**Blocks These Initiatives:**

- All production deployment decisions
- Phase 1: Resource Stability (security gates deployment)
- Phase 2: Data Integrity (security testing infrastructure needed)

---

## Related Initiatives

**Prerequisites:**

None

**Synergistic:**

- [Phase 1: Resource Stability](./2025-10-20-phase-1-resource-stability.md) - Security + stability = production readiness
- [Phase 2: Data Integrity](./2025-10-20-phase-2-data-integrity.md) - Quality + security = user trust

**Sequential Work:**

This initiative → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Detection rate <90% | High | Medium | Extensive prompt engineering, golden tests, accept false positives over false negatives |
| Performance overhead >5% | Medium | Low | Optimize sanitization, cache detection results, parallel processing |
| OAuth complexity exceeds estimate | Low | Medium | Defer OAuth to v0.4.0, use API key for v0.3.0 |
| False positives block legitimate use | Medium | Medium | Confidence thresholds, user override for low-risk operations, feedback loop |
| Security test maintenance burden | Medium | Medium | Automated test generation, community contributions, quarterly review |

## Updates

### 2025-10-20 (Creation)

Initiative created based on comprehensive technical roadmap analysis.

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Layered Defense**: Sanitization + detection + validation (defense-in-depth)
2. **API Key First**: OAuth deferred to v0.4.0 (pragmatic approach)
3. **Pattern + ML**: Hybrid detection for best accuracy vs performance
4. **Security as Default**: Auth required by default, explicit opt-out only

**Research Findings:**

- OWASP LLM Top 10 2025: Prompt injection remains #1 threat
- MCP OAuth 2.1: Alibaba disclosure highlights PKCE + state validation requirements
- Detection Accuracy: Pattern-based achieves 70-80%, ML can reach 90-95%
- Performance: Sanitization typically <5ms overhead, detection <10ms

**Next Steps:**

1. Phase 1: Security audit (identify all attack surfaces)
2. Phase 2: Implement sanitization + detection
3. Phase 3: Add authentication middleware
4. Phase 4: Comprehensive security testing
5. Phase 5: Security sign-off
