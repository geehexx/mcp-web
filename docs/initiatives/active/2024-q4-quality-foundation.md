# Initiative: Quality Foundation & Testing Excellence

**Status:** Active
**Created:** 2025-10-15
**Owner:** Core Team
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Duration:** 4 weeks
**Target Completion:** 2025-11-15

---

## Objective

Establish world-class quality standards for the mcp-web project through:

1. Comprehensive testing coverage (85%+)
2. Documentation linting and quality enforcement
3. Missing test scenarios (query-aware, Playwright, robots.txt)
4. CLI testing endpoint for manual verification
5. Improved static analysis (mypy configuration)
6. Clean documentation structure with ADRs and archiving

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Test coverage ≥85% across all modules
- [ ] All documentation passes markdownlint + Vale
- [ ] Zero double-spaces or LLM artifacts in docs
- [ ] Markdown/prose linting in CI/CD
- [ ] CLI endpoint for URL summarization testing
- [ ] Query-aware summarization tests (10+ scenarios)
- [ ] Playwright fallback tests (5+ scenarios)
- [ ] robots.txt tests (handling + ignoring)
- [ ] mypy strict mode enabled with no errors
- [ ] Documentation restructured per DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md
- [ ] All decisions converted to ADR format
- [ ] Improvement docs archived appropriately

---

## Motivation

The project has grown rapidly but needs stronger quality foundations:

**Current State:**

- ~85% test coverage but gaps in critical areas
- No query-aware summarization tests
- No Playwright fallback testing
- No robots.txt testing
- Documentation has LLM artifacts and redundancy
- No prose quality checking
- Decisions in single file (not sustainable long-term)
- No clear place for initiatives/roadmap
- No archiving strategy for historical docs

**Desired State:**

- Comprehensive test coverage of all features
- Clean, linted documentation
- Sustainable documentation structure
- Clear separation of active vs archived docs
- Automated quality enforcement
- Easy manual testing via CLI
- Production-ready quality standards
