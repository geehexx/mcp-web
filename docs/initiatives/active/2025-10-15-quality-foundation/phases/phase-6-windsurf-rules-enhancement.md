# Phase 6: Windsurf Rules Enhancement

**Status:** ⏳ Pending
**Duration:** 2 days (estimated)
**Owner:** Core Team

---

## Objective

Enhance Windsurf agent rules with external references, code examples, and best practices documentation.

---

## Tasks

- [ ] **Add more external references to python.md** (1h)
  - Link to official Python docs
  - Add PEP references for patterns
  - Include community best practices

- [ ] **Add code examples to security.md** (1h)
  - OWASP examples
  - Secure coding patterns
  - Common vulnerability demonstrations

- [ ] **Link to ADRs from rules** (30min)
  - Cross-reference architectural decisions
  - Link related ADRs to rule sections
  - Create bidirectional references

- [ ] **Link to CONSTITUTION.md from rules** (30min)
  - Reference core principles
  - Align rules with constitution
  - Establish clear hierarchy

- [ ] **Add testing best practices section** (1h)
  - Pytest patterns
  - Fixture organization
  - Test naming conventions
  - Coverage strategies

- [ ] **Add async patterns section with examples** (2h)
  - asyncio best practices
  - Common pitfalls
  - Performance patterns
  - Error handling in async code

---

## Deliverables

- Enhanced `.windsurf/rules/02_python_standards.md`
- Enhanced `.windsurf/rules/04_security.md`
- Enhanced `.windsurf/rules/01_testing_and_tooling.md`
- Cross-reference updates in ADRs and CONSTITUTION.md

---

## Success Criteria

- All rules have ≥3 external references
- Security rules have ≥5 code examples
- All ADRs linked from relevant rules
- CONSTITUTION referenced in core directive rules
- Testing section has ≥10 best practices
- Async section has ≥5 code examples

---

## Notes

This phase focuses on making Windsurf rules more actionable and well-documented with concrete examples and authoritative references.
