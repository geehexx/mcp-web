# Initiative: Workflow Automation Enhancement

---

## Objective

Reduce AI agent token expenditure by 30-50% through automation of repetitive, low-intelligence workflow tasks such as template scaffolding,
file operations, frontmatter management, and structured data extraction. Create reusable Python scripts and Taskfile commands that both AI
agents and human developers can invoke.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Template scaffolding system implemented for initiatives, ADRs, and session summaries
- [ ] File operation helper scripts created (archive, move, update indices)
- [ ] Frontmatter validation and generation tooling in place
- [ ] Session summary consolidation automated (JSON extraction + merging)
- [ ] Taskfile commands integrated for all automation scripts
- [ ] Documentation created for both AI and human usage
- [ ] Token reduction measured: 30-50% decrease in workflow overhead
- [ ] All scripts have comprehensive tests (≥90% coverage)

## Motivation

**Problem:**

Current workflows require AI agents to:

- Manually construct complex file structures (initiatives with phases/artifacts, ADRs with standard sections)
- Perform repetitive file operations (move files, update READMEs, create directories)
- Generate YAML frontmatter with correct schema for every document
- Extract and consolidate session summaries using LLM-heavy token-intensive processes
- Execute standardized git operations repeatedly

This wastes tokens on tasks that require minimal intelligence and maximal precision.

**Impact:**

- **Token waste:** Estimated 2,000-5,000 tokens per workflow invocation on template generation
- **Error-prone:** Manual file operations and frontmatter generation prone to typos, missing fields
- **Slow:** AI generates templates line-by-line instead of instant scaffolding
- **Inconsistent:** Templates vary between invocations despite documented standards

**Value:**

- **30-50% token reduction:** Offload mechanical tasks to scripts
- **100% consistency:** Templates always match standards
- **10x faster:** Instant scaffolding vs line-by-line generation
- **Developer-friendly:** Scripts usable by humans, not just AI
- **Scalable:** Easy to add new template types

## Scope

### In Scope

#### Phase 1: Template Scaffolding System

- Python-based template engine using Jinja2
- Templates for: initiatives, ADRs, session summaries, workflows, rules
- Support for folder-based initiatives (per PROPOSAL-folder-based-structure.md)
- Interactive prompts for required fields
- Taskfile integration (`task scaffold:initiative`, etc.)

#### Phase 2: File Operation Helpers

- Archive initiative script (move + update references + add archived notice)
- Move file with reference update script
- Update index/README automation
- Directory creation with structure validation

#### Phase 3: Frontmatter Management

- Frontmatter validator (check required fields, enum values, dates)
- Frontmatter generator from templates
- Frontmatter updater (merge new fields into existing)
- Pre-commit hook integration

#### Phase 4: Session Summary Automation

- YAML extraction script (converts summary markdown → structured YAML)
- Summary consolidation script (merges multiple YAML extractions)
- Template-based summary generation from YAML
- Validation against session summary schema

#### Phase 5: Documentation & Integration

- User guide for each script (`docs/guides/AUTOMATION_TOOLS.md`)
- Update workflows to use new scripts (replace manual steps)
- Create `/scaffold` workflow for quick template generation
- Integration tests for all scripts

### Out of Scope

- Complex AI decision-making (remains in agent workflows)
- Code generation or refactoring automation
- External API integrations
- Full cookiecutter adoption (keeping it simple with custom scripts)
- GUI or web interface (CLI only)
- Cross-repository tooling

## Research Summary

### Key Findings

**Template Scaffolding Tools:**

- **Cookiecutter:** Python-based, Jinja2 templates, industry standard for project scaffolding
- **Plop:** JavaScript micro-generator, excellent for component-based generation
- **Hygen:** Fast, customizable, language-agnostic
- **Custom Jinja2:** Simpler for our use case, zero external dependencies beyond Jinja2

**Decision:** Use **custom Python scripts with Jinja2** for:

- Full control over template logic
- Easy integration with existing Python tooling
- No learning curve for cookiecutter's specific patterns
- Simpler for single-repo use case

**Best Practices (from research):**

- Store templates in `scripts/templates/` directory
- Use YAML for template configuration (matches frontmatter)
- Provide both interactive and non-interactive modes (for CI/human use)
- Validate generated files immediately after scaffolding
- Support dry-run mode for testing

### Technology Stack

**Core Tools:**

- **Jinja2** (already installed): Template rendering
- **pyyaml** (already installed): Frontmatter parsing
- **python-frontmatter** (new): Markdown frontmatter manipulation
- **click** (already via uv): CLI argument parsing
- **Taskfile**: Command orchestration

**No additional heavy dependencies required.**

### YAML vs JSON for Data Extraction (October 2025 Research)

**Finding:** YAML is **30% more token-efficient** than JSON for LLM-generated structured output.

**Evidence:**

- Microsoft Data Science team research (Oct 2025): YAML required 260 tokens vs 370 for JSON (30% reduction)
- LLaMA tokenizer analysis: 98 tokens for YAML vs 149 for JSON (34% reduction)
- Better human readability with no special characters overhead

**Decision:** Use YAML for session summary extraction (Phase 4)

- **Benefits:** 30% token savings, better readability, pyyaml already installed
- **Application:** Session summary consolidation workflow

### Token Cost Analysis

**Current Token Costs (Estimated):**

| Workflow Operation | Current Cost | With Automation | Savings |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| Create initiative (flat file) | ~1,500 tokens | ~50 tokens (invoke script) | 97% |
| Create initiative (folder-based) | ~3,000 tokens | ~100 tokens | 97% |
| Create ADR | ~1,200 tokens | ~50 tokens | 96% |
| Create session summary | ~2,500 tokens | ~100 tokens | 96% |
| Archive initiative | ~800 tokens | ~30 tokens | 96% |
| Consolidate summaries | ~5,000 tokens | ~350 tokens | 93% |
| Generate frontmatter | ~300 tokens | ~10 tokens | 97% |
| **Total per session** | **~14,000 tokens** | **~690 tokens** | **95%** |

**Annual Savings (assuming 100 workflow invocations):**

- **1.4M tokens → 69K tokens** (95% reduction in mechanical overhead)
- More tokens available for actual problem-solving

**Research Source:** Microsoft Data Science team (Oct 2025) demonstrated YAML uses 30% fewer tokens than JSON for structured LLM output

**Exit Criteria:** ✅ ALL MET

- ✅ All templates render correctly with test data
- ✅ CLI accepts both interactive and config file modes
- ✅ Taskfile commands work end-to-end
- ✅ Tests pass with 100% pass rate (26/26 tests)

### Phase 2: File Operation Helpers (4 hours)

- [ ] Create `scripts/file_ops.py` module
- [ ] Implement `archive_initiative()`:
  - [ ] Add ARCHIVED notice to file
  - [ ] Move to `docs/initiatives/completed/`
  - [ ] Update cross-references in other files
  - [ ] Update `docs/initiatives/README.md` index
- [ ] Implement `move_file_with_refs()`:
  - [ ] Move file to new location
  - [ ] Find all references (grep search)
  - [ ] Update relative paths in referring files
  - [ ] Validate no broken links remain
- [ ] Implement `update_index()`:
  - [ ] Scan directory for new/moved files
  - [ ] Generate alphabetical index
  - [ ] Update README with new entries
- [ ] Add Taskfile commands:
  - [ ] `task archive:initiative <name>`
  - [ ] `task move:file <src> <dst>`
  - [ ] `task update:index <dir>`

### Phase 3: Frontmatter Management (3 hours) - ✅ **COMPLETE VIA INITIATIVE-SYSTEM**

**Status:** Completed by [Initiative System Lifecycle Improvements](../2025-10-19-initiative-system-lifecycle-improvements/initiative.md) Phase 1-2

**Delivered (2025-10-19):**

## Related Initiatives

**Synergistic:**

- [Windsurf Workflows V2 Optimization](../2025-10-17-windsurf-workflows-v2-optimization/initiative.md) - Phase 8 (Quality Automation) will use these tools
- [Session Summary Consolidation](../2025-10-19-session-summary-consolidation-workflow/initiative.md) - Uses scaffolding tools for initiative creation

**Sequential Work:**

- Phase 1 complete → Phase 2-6 planned
- Phase 4-5 (Frontmatter + Consolidation) feed into consolidation workflow

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Scripts too complex for users | Medium | Low | Provide simple Taskfile commands, hide complexity |
| Breaking existing workflows | High | Medium | Phased rollout, keep old manual methods working initially |
| Template schema drift | Medium | Medium | Add frontmatter validation to CI, update templates in lockstep |
| Performance issues (large files) | Low | Low | Profile scripts, optimize file operations, use streaming |
| Insufficient test coverage | Medium | Low | Enforce ≥90% coverage, integration tests required |
| Folder-based proposal rejected | High | Medium | Build templates for both flat and folder, make switchable |
