# Meta-Analysis Artifact Tracking System

**Purpose:** Differentiate between implementation during session, meta-analysis additions, and deferred work.

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025

---

## Artifact Categories

### 1. Session Implementation (During Work)

**Definition:** Changes made as part of the primary session objective.

**Location:** Mixed (code, tests, docs)

**Tracking:** Via git commits during session

**Example:**

```markdown
Session: "Implement API Authentication"

Implemented During Session:
- src/mcp_web/auth.py (new feature)
- tests/unit/test_auth.py (feature tests)
- docs/API.md (feature documentation)

Commits:
- feat(auth): add API key validation
- test(auth): add validation tests
- docs(api): document authentication
```

### 2. Meta-Analysis Additions (Post-Session)

**Definition:** Improvements identified during meta-analysis of the session.

**Location:** Primarily `.windsurf/`, `docs/standards/`, `docs/archive/`

**Tracking:** Clearly marked in meta-analysis document

**Example:**

```markdown
Session: "Implement API Authentication"

Added During Meta-Analysis:
- .windsurf/workflows/security-review.md (new workflow)
- .windsurf/rules/02_python_standards.md (updated auth patterns)
- docs/standards/API_SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md (new standard)
- docs/archive/session-summaries/2025-10-15-api-auth.md (summary)

Commits:
- docs(meta): add security review workflow
- docs(rules): add authentication patterns
- docs(standards): create API security checklist
- docs(archive): session summary for API auth implementation
```

### 3. Deferred Work (To Do Later)

**Definition:** Items identified but not implemented.

**Location:** `docs/initiatives/active/` or inline `TODO` markers

**Tracking:** Initiative documents or issue tracker

**Example:**

```markdown
Session: "Implement API Authentication"

Deferred for Later:
- OAuth2 integration (see: docs/initiatives/active/oauth2-integration.md)
- Database-backed key storage (TODO in src/mcp_web/auth.py)
- Rate limiting per API key (issue #42)
- Key rotation automation (future enhancement)

Rationale: MVP complete, enhancements planned for Phase 2
```

---

## Marking System

### In Commits

**Session work:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add API key validation"
```

**Meta-analysis:**

```bash
git commit -m "docs(meta): add authentication workflow

Meta-analysis: Added security review workflow based on
authentication implementation patterns observed in session.

Refs: META_ANALYSIS_SESSION_2025_10_15.md"
```

**Deferred work:**

```bash
git commit -m "docs(initiative): create OAuth2 integration plan

Deferred: OAuth2 identified as needed but out of scope for
current authentication MVP. Planned for Phase 2.

Refs: docs/initiatives/active/oauth2-integration.md"
```

### In Meta-Analysis Documents

**Clear section headers:**

```markdown
## Changes Implemented

1. **API Authentication Module**
 - Files: src/mcp_web/auth.py, tests/unit/test_auth.py
 - Commits: abc1234, def5678
 - Status: ✅ Complete, production-ready

### During Meta-Analysis (Process Improvements)

1. **Security Review Workflow**
 - File: .windsurf/workflows/security-review.md
 - Commits: ghi9012
 - Reason: Identified gap in security validation process
 - Status: ✅ Complete, ready for use

2. **Authentication Patterns Documentation**
 - File: .windsurf/rules/02_python_standards.md (updated)
 - Commits: jkl3456
 - Reason: Establish consistent auth patterns for future features
 - Status: ✅ Complete

### Deferred to Future Work

1. **OAuth2 Integration**
 - Initiative: docs/initiatives/active/oauth2-integration.md
 - Priority: Medium
 - Estimated Effort: 16 hours
 - Reason: Phase 2 enhancement, MVP sufficient
 - Status: 📋 Planned

2. **Database Key Storage**
 - Location: TODO comment in src/mcp_web/auth.py
 - Priority: Low
 - Estimated Effort: 4 hours
 - Reason: In-memory sufficient for current scale
 - Status: 📋 Planned

3. **Automated Key Rotation**
 - Location: Issue #47
 - Priority: Low
 - Estimated Effort: 8 hours
 - Reason: Manual rotation adequate for MVP
 - Status: 📋 Backlog
```

## File Organization

### Session Summaries

**Location:** `docs/archive/session-summaries/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`

**Contains:**

- What was implemented (session work)
- What was improved (meta-analysis)
- What was deferred (future work)
- Clear differentiation between categories

**Template Section:**

```markdown
## Artifact Classification

### Implemented This Session
[List with commits]

### Added During Meta-Analysis
[List with commits and rationale]

### Deferred for Future
[List with tracking location]
```

### Initiatives

**Active:** `docs/initiatives/active/name.md`

- Current work
- Deferred enhancements from previous sessions

**Completed:** `docs/initiatives/completed/YYYY-QN-name.md`

- Archived when fully done
- Include meta-analysis insights

---

## Best Practices

### DO

✅ **Clearly mark meta-analysis commits**

```bash
git commit -m "docs(meta): add workflow

Meta-analysis: ..."
```

✅ **Create initiatives for deferred work**

```markdown
Don't just leave TODO comments, create tracked initiative
```

✅ **Document rationale for deferral**

```markdown
Why defer? Too complex? Out of scope? Lower priority?
```

✅ **Link between artifacts**

```markdown
Session summary → Initiative document
Initiative → ADR (if architectural)
ADR → Implementation commits
```

### DON'T

❌ **Mix session work and meta-analysis in same commit**

❌ **Leave deferred work untracked**

❌ **Create meta-analysis artifacts without clear value**

- Don't document "obvious" patterns
- Don't create workflows for one-off scenarios

❌ **Forget to update tracking locations**

- Initiative status
- TODO markers
- Issue tracker

## Reporting Template

### For Meta-Analysis Documents

```markdown
## Artifact Summary

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Session Implementation** | 5 files | auth.py, test_auth.py, API.md, ... |
| **Meta-Analysis Additions** | 3 files | security-review.md, standards update, ... |
| **Deferred Items** | 4 initiatives | OAuth2, DB storage, rotation, monitoring |

### Session Work (Primary Objective)

**Feature: API Key Authentication**

Files Changed:
- src/mcp_web/auth.py (new, 250 lines)
- tests/unit/test_auth.py (new, 180 lines)
- docs/API.md (updated, +50 lines)

Commits:
- feat(auth): implement API key validation (abc1234)
- test(auth): add comprehensive test suite (def5678)
- docs(api): document authentication usage (ghi9012)

Status: ✅ Complete, 100% test coverage, production-ready

---

### Meta-Analysis Additions (Process Improvements)

**1. Security Review Workflow**

File: .windsurf/workflows/security-review.md (new, 400 lines)
Commit: jkl3456

**Rationale:** Implementing authentication revealed a gap in our security
validation process. Created standardized workflow to ensure all security
features follow consistent review process (OWASP checklist, threat modeling,
penetration testing plan).

**Impact:** Future security features will have consistent review process,
reducing vulnerability risk.

Status: ✅ Complete

**2. Authentication Patterns (Rules Update)**

File: .windsurf/rules/02_python_standards.md (updated, +100 lines)
Commit: mno7890

**Rationale:** Established reusable patterns for:
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt parameters)
- API key generation (entropy requirements)
- Token validation (timing attack prevention)

**Impact:** Next auth feature can reuse patterns, reducing implementation
time and security review burden.

Status: ✅ Complete

---

### Deferred Work (Future Enhancements)

**1. OAuth2/OIDC Integration**

Document: docs/initiatives/active/oauth2-integration.md
Priority: Medium
Estimate: 16 hours (4 sessions)

**Rationale:** OAuth2 provides better security and UX for web applications.
Current API key auth sufficient for API/CLI use cases. OAuth2 deferred until
web UI requirements are finalized.

**Trigger:** Web UI project start
Status: 📋 Planned, not started

**2. Database-Backed Key Storage**

Location: TODO in src/mcp_web/auth.py:42
Priority: Low
Estimate: 4 hours (1 session)

**Rationale:** In-memory storage fine for ≤100 keys and single-instance
deployment. Database needed when:
- Key count >100
- Multi-instance deployment
- Key persistence across restarts required

**Trigger:** Production deployment requirements
Status: 📋 Planned, low priority

---

### Summary Statistics

**Session Duration:** 4 hours
**Primary Objective:** ✅ Complete (API auth implemented)
**Meta-Analysis Artifacts:** 2 created, 1 updated
**Deferred Items:** 4 identified and tracked
**Quality:** All tests pass, lint clean, security reviewed
**Commits:** 8 total (5 feature, 2 meta, 1 docs)
```
