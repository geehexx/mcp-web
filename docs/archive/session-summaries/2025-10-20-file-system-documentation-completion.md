- Marked all 8 success criteria as complete
- Added comprehensive Phase 4 completion update
- Changed status to "Completed"
- Added completion date
- Archived from active/ to completed/ using automation script

**Timeline:**
- **Total Duration:** 4 hours (estimated 6.5-8 hours)
- **Phase 1 (Research & Design):** 1 hour
- **Phase 2 (Implementation):** ~2 hours
- **Phase 3 (Testing):** ~1 hour
- **Phase 4 (Documentation):** ~0.5 hours (this session)

**Outcome:** Delivered ahead of schedule with comprehensive documentation.

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Documentation Structure

**Decision:** Create dedicated File System Support section in API.md rather than inline documentation

**Rationale:**
- Feature significant enough to warrant dedicated section
- Improves discoverability (table of contents entry)
- Allows comprehensive treatment of security, examples, and configuration
- Follows same pattern as other major features

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Inline documentation in existing sections (rejected - less discoverable)
- Separate file (rejected - adds navigation complexity)

### 2. Example Complexity

**Decision:** Provide 4 progressively complex examples (session summary ‚Üí docs ‚Üí code ‚Üí mixed)

**Rationale:**
- Covers common use cases
- Demonstrates feature flexibility
- Shows file:// URL and absolute path formats
- Mixed example shows real-world usage

**Impact:** Users can quickly find relevant example for their use case.

### 3. Security Documentation Depth

**Decision:** Document both security controls AND blocked attack scenarios

**Rationale:**
- Security-conscious users need to validate safety
- Attack scenarios demonstrate thoroughness
- Best practices guide safe configuration
- Builds trust in implementation

**References:** Following OWASP documentation best practices

## Key Learnings

### 1. Markdown Linting Requires Proper Heading Structure

**Issue:** Pre-commit hook failed with MD036 errors (emphasis used instead of heading)

**Cause:** Used `**Example 1:**` format instead of `#### Example 1`

**Fix:** Changed all bold-as-heading patterns to proper heading syntax

**Lesson:** Always use proper heading hierarchy for examples and subsections

### 2. Initiative Validation Requires Archival Before Commit

**Issue:** Pre-commit hook failed validation - initiative marked "Completed" but in active/ directory

**Cause:** Updated status to "Completed" but didn't archive

**Fix:** Used `task archive:initiative` automation script before committing

**Lesson:** Archive completed initiatives immediately after marking complete

**Impact:** Automation script updated cross-references automatically (docs/initiatives/README.md)

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation Adds Significant Value

**Observation:** 230-line documentation section seems extensive, but covers:
- 3 input formats with examples
- 6 file types
- Configuration (code + env vars)
- Security (validation + attacks + best practices)
- 4 usage examples
- Implementation details

**Lesson:** Production-ready documentation requires comprehensive coverage

**Validation:** All examples tested, security claims verified against implementation
