# Meta-Analysis: Intelligent Commit Strategy Session

**Date:** 2025-10-15, 12:00-12:15 UTC+07
**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Focus:** Demonstrating and documenting intelligent commit practices

---

## Session Objectives

1. ✅ Commit consolidation work from previous session
2. ✅ Plan ADR conversion work with intelligent commit strategy
3. ✅ Implement several ADRs with commits throughout (not batched at end)
4. ✅ Run meta-analysis to capture learnings
5. Commit meta-analysis results

---

## Key Learning: Intelligent Commit Strategy

### Problem Identified

**From user feedback:**
> "We're not committing intelligently, which we should do so... A failing we have learnt from is I called /work without any context hoping it would pick up from the conversation that stated we should commit as well."

**Root causes:**

1. **Batch commits at end:** Previous sessions committed all work in single large commit
2. **Context loss:** Without recent commits, `/work` couldn't detect state from conversation alone
3. **Poor history:** Large batches hide logical progression
4. **Hard to review:** 1000+ line diffs are difficult to review
5. **Risky rollbacks:** Can't revert specific changes without losing others

### Solution Implemented

**Commit after each logical unit:**

- ✅ Per ADR or small grouping (2-3 related ADRs)
- ✅ Per feature or fix
- ✅ Per documentation section
- ❌ NOT all at session end

**Benefits demonstrated:**

1. **Clear history:** Each commit has single purpose
2. **Easy review:** Small, focused diffs
3. **Granular rollback:** Can revert specific ADR without affecting others
4. **Better /work detection:** Recent commits show project state
5. **Continuous integration:** Can test after each commit

### Commit 2: Initiative Plan (4cd54f1)

```text
docs(initiative): create plan for converting DD-002 to DD-010 to ADRs

- Detailed implementation strategy with intelligent commit plan
- Commit after each ADR or logical grouping (not batch at end)
- Document medium-term ADRs needed (uv, pytest-xdist, etc.)
- Estimated 2-3 hours total
```

**Why separate:** Planning is distinct from execution

**Files:** 1 changed, 182 insertions(+)

---

### Commit 3: Work Status Tracking (f2900a5)

```text
docs(meta): add current work status tracking

Temporary file to track session progress and ensure visibility
of work state across context windows.
```

**Why separate:** Meta-tracking tool, not primary work

**Files:** 1 changed, 126 insertions(+)

---

### Commit 4: ADR-0004 (3bc16ea)

```text
docs(adr): add ADR-0004 trafilatura content extraction

Converts DD-002 from DECISIONS.md to proper ADR format.

- Decision: Use trafilatura with favor_recall=True
- Evaluated 4 alternatives (BeautifulSoup, newspaper3k, Readability, ML)
- Benchmark results: 95% accuracy on news, 92% on blogs
- Implementation in src/mcp_web/extractor.py
```

**Why separate:** One ADR = one commit (easy to revert if needed)

**Files:** 1 changed, 230 insertions(+)

---

### Commit 5: ADR-0005 and ADR-0006 (3648619)

```text
docs(adr): add ADR-0005 and ADR-0006 chunking strategy

ADR-0005: Hierarchical and semantic chunking
- Decision: Respect document structure + semantic boundaries
- Evaluated 4 alternatives
- 9.2/10 summary coherence vs 6.5/10 for fixed-size

ADR-0006: Chunk size and overlap parameters
- Decision: 512 tokens with 50-token overlap (10%)
- Evaluated 5 alternatives
- Optimal balance of quality and cost
```

**Why grouped:** Closely related (chunking approach + parameters)

**Files:** 2 changed, 524 insertions(+)

---

## Pattern Analysis

### Commit Frequency

**This session:** 5 commits in 15 minutes = 1 commit every 3 minutes of active work

**Previous pattern:** 1 commit per session (batched at end)

**Improvement:** 5x more granular history

### Commit Size Distribution

| Commit | Files | Lines | Type |
|--------|-------|-------|------|
| 1 (Consolidation) | 12 | +3568/-457 | Large (cleanup) |
| 2 (Plan) | 1 | +182 | Small (doc) |
| 3 (Status) | 1 | +126 | Small (tool) |
| 4 (ADR-0004) | 1 | +230 | Medium (ADR) |
| 5 (ADR-0005/6) | 2 | +524 | Medium (ADR group) |

**Observation:** Most commits are small-to-medium (1-2 files, 100-500 lines)

---

## Best Practices Identified

### 1. Commit After Each Logical Unit

✅ **DO:**

- One ADR → one commit
- One feature → one commit
- One fix → one commit
- Related items (2-3) → one commit if closely coupled

❌ **DON'T:**

- Batch unrelated work
- Wait until end of session
- Mix multiple concerns

### 2. Write Descriptive Commit Messages

**Format:** `type(scope): description`

**Good example:**

```text
docs(adr): add ADR-0004 trafilatura content extraction

Converts DD-002 from DECISIONS.md to proper ADR format.

- Decision: Use trafilatura with favor_recall=True
- Evaluated 4 alternatives
- Benchmark results included
```

**Bad example:**

```text
add adr
```

### 3. Group Related Changes

**When to group:**

- Strategy + parameters (ADR-0005 + ADR-0006)
- Interface + implementation
- Code + tests (for same feature)

**When NOT to group:**

- Unrelated ADRs
- Different features
- Multiple bug fixes

### 4. Use Pre-commit Hooks

**Observed:** Pre-commit hooks automatically fix trailing whitespace

**Benefit:** Consistent formatting without manual intervention

**Pattern:** Commit often fixes format issues, then real commit succeeds

### Git Best Practices

**Consulted:**

- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- [Git Best Practices (Seth Robertson)](http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/)
- [Commit Often, Perfect Later](http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/#commit)

**Key principles:**

1. Commit early and often
2. Don't commit half-done work (but DO commit logical units)
3. Test before you commit
4. Write good commit messages
5. Use branches for experiments

### hexacore-command Patterns

**User mentioned:** "There are also guidelines you can learn from for intelligent git commiting from `/home/gxx/projects/hexacore-command`"

**Action item:** Review hexacore-command commit patterns in future session

---

## Impact on Workflow

### `/work` Context Detection

**Before (batch commits):**

- Large time gap between commits
- Recent work not visible in git history
- `/work` relies on conversation context (which doesn't persist across sessions)

**After (frequent commits):**

- Recent commits show current work
- Git history provides context
- `/work` can detect state from commits alone

**Example:**

```bash
$ git log --oneline -5
3648619 docs(adr): add ADR-0005 and ADR-0006 chunking strategy
3bc16ea docs(adr): add ADR-0004 trafilatura content extraction
f2900a5 docs(meta): add current work status tracking
4cd54f1 docs(initiative): create plan for converting DD-002 to DD-010 to ADRs
b7ee70b docs(consolidation): consolidate workflows and create ADRs 0002-0003
```

**Observation:** Clear progression visible

---

## Improvements for Next Session

### 1. Commit Frequency Targets

**Target:** 1 commit per 15-30 minutes of focused work

**Metrics:**

- Short sessions (<1 hour): 2-4 commits
- Medium sessions (1-2 hours): 4-8 commits
- Long sessions (2+ hours): 8+ commits

### 2. Automated Commit Reminders

**Idea:** Create checkpoint markers in workflow

**Implementation:**

- After completing each ADR
- After passing tests
- Before context window fills up

### 3. Commit Message Templates

**Create templates for common commit types:**

```bash
# ADR template
docs(adr): add ADR-NNNN <title>

Converts DD-NNN from DECISIONS.md to proper ADR format.

- Decision: <summary>
- Evaluated N alternatives
- <key metric or finding>

Refs: DD-NNN, docs/initiatives/active/convert-decisions-to-adrs.md
```

### 4. Pre-commit Checklist

**Before each commit:**

- [ ] Tests pass (if code changed)
- [ ] Linting clean (if code changed)
- [ ] Docs updated (if API changed)
- [ ] Conventional commit format
- [ ] Single logical concern

- [ ] Update ADR README
- [ ] Archive DECISIONS.md

**Status:** 6/12 complete (50%)

**Estimated remaining:** 1.5-2 hours (6 ADRs + cleanup)

---

## Learnings Summary

### What Worked Well

✅ **Frequent commits** - Clear history, easy to follow progress
✅ **Descriptive messages** - Each commit tells a story
✅ **Logical grouping** - Related ADRs grouped, unrelated separated
✅ **Pre-commit hooks** - Automatic formatting consistency
✅ **Work status tracking** - CURRENT_WORK_STATUS.md maintains visibility

### What Could Be Improved

⚠️ **Commit before context fills** - Should commit more proactively
⚠️ **Test after each commit** - Didn't run tests (no code changes, but good practice)
⚠️ **Branch usage** - Could use feature branches for large work
⚠️ **Squash opportunities** - Some commits could be squashed before push

### Process Improvements

1. **Workflow checkpoint markers** - Add "COMMIT NOW" reminders in workflows
2. **Commit frequency metrics** - Track and report commit patterns
3. **Auto-test integration** - Run tests automatically in workflow
4. **hexacore-command review** - Study their commit patterns
