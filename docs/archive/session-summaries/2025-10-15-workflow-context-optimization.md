# Session Summary: Workflow Context Detection Optimization

**Date:** 2025-10-15, 12:24-13:00 UTC+07
**Duration:** ~35 minutes
**Focus:** Optimize workflows to use session summaries for cross-session context detection

---

## Objectives

1. Enable `/work` workflow to use session summaries for cross-session context detection
2. Integrate web search into `/plan` workflow as a required step
3. Update session summary standards to emphasize AI-parseable "Next Steps"
4. Update meta-analysis workflow to validate context-friendly format

---

## Completed

### 1. Enhanced /work Workflow Context Detection

**File:** `.windsurf/workflows/work.md`

**Changes:**

- ‚úÖ Added session summaries as **priority 0** context source (before initiatives)
- ‚úÖ Added "Why session summaries matter" explanation
- ‚úÖ Updated cross-session resumption logic to prioritize summaries
- ‚úÖ Added Anthropic research reference on context compaction
- ‚úÖ Documented that session summaries = compressed context from previous sessions

**Impact:**

- AI agents can now pick up work from previous sessions without conversation history
- Session summaries provide 2-3 most recent work contexts automatically
- Cross-session continuity improved significantly

### 2. Web Search Integration in /plan Workflow

**File:** `.windsurf/workflows/plan.md`

**Changes:**

- ‚úÖ Changed from "Web search for best practices" to "ALWAYS use web search"
- ‚úÖ Added explicit `search_web()` tool examples
- ‚úÖ Documented why web search is essential (evolving tech, security, patterns)
- ‚úÖ Added 5-point search strategy (broad ‚Üí specific ‚Üí security ‚Üí recent ‚Üí production)
- ‚úÖ Emphasized citing actual URLs from search results

**Rationale:**

- User feedback: workflows should use [web] command for research
- Technology evolves rapidly - 2025 best practices differ from 2023
- Security vulnerabilities discovered regularly
- Community consensus shifts over time

### 3. Session Summary Standards Enhancement

**File:** `docs/standards/SUMMARY_STANDARDS.md`

**Changes:**

- ‚úÖ Added "CRITICAL" marker to "Next Steps" section
- ‚úÖ Added format requirements for AI agent context detection
- ‚úÖ Added priority indicators with emojis (üî¥üü°üü¢‚ö™)
- ‚úÖ Added cross-session context requirements checklist
- ‚úÖ Enhanced "Next Steps" guidelines with good/bad examples
- ‚úÖ Emphasized: no assumptions about prior conversation

**Key additions:**

```markdown
**Format requirements for AI agent context detection:**
- ‚úÖ Be explicit: "Fix 4 failing tests in tests/unit/test_security.py"
- ‚úÖ Include paths: "Continue ADR conversion in docs/adr/"
- ‚úÖ Reference initiatives: "Resume docs/initiatives/active/quality-foundation.md Phase 2"
- ‚ùå Avoid vague: "Continue the work" or "Fix remaining issues"
```

### 4. Meta-Analysis Workflow Validation

**File:** `.windsurf/workflows/meta-analysis.md`

**Changes:**

- ‚úÖ Added section 1.3: "Validate Context-Friendly Format"
- ‚úÖ Added validation checklist for "Next Steps" section
- ‚úÖ Added good vs bad examples of context-friendly summaries
- ‚úÖ Added "context detection failures" to critical improvements focus
- ‚úÖ Added test: "Could a new AI agent pick up work from this summary alone?"

**Validation checklist:**

- [ ] Specific file paths
- [ ] Initiative links
- [ ] Commands included
- [ ] Priority indicators
- [ ] No assumptions
- [ ] Continuation points

## Research Findings

### Anthropic Context Engineering Research

**Source:** https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents

**Key insights applied:**

1. **Compaction strategy:** Session summaries as compressed context
2. **Context rot:** As tokens increase, recall decreases - need curation
3. **Structured note-taking:** Persistent memory outside context window
4. **High-fidelity summarization:** Preserve decisions, bugs, implementation details

**Applied pattern:**

```text
Session summaries = Compacted context from previous sessions
- Preserve: Architectural decisions, unresolved bugs, next steps
- Discard: Verbose details (available in git history)
- Enable: Cross-session continuity without conversation history
```

### Claude Agent SDK Best Practices

**Source:** https://skywork.ai/blog/claude-agent-sdk-best-practices-ai-agents-2025/

**Key insights applied:**

1. **Control context and memory:** Isolate, compact, standardize
2. **Periodic reset or prune context:** Prefer retrieval and summaries
3. **Compress global state aggressively:** Store just plan, decisions, artifacts

**Applied pattern:**

- Session summaries = periodic context pruning mechanism
- Next steps section = compressed global state
- Initiative links = retrieval mechanism

## Commits

```text
[Pending] docs(workflows): optimize context detection with session summaries

- Enhanced /work workflow to prioritize session summaries (step 0)
- Added @web search integration to /plan workflow (required)
- Updated session summary standards for AI-parseable format
- Added context-friendly validation to /meta-analysis workflow
- Based on Anthropic research on context compaction and engineering

## Key Learnings

### 1. Session Summaries Are Critical for Cross-Session Context

**Problem:** AI agents in new sessions have no conversation history
**Solution:** Session summaries as "compressed context" from previous work
**Impact:** Enables intelligent `/work` continuation without user explanation

### 2. Web Search Must Be Workflow Default, Not Optional

**Problem:** Technology evolves rapidly, workflows had static examples
**Solution:** Make `search_web()` tool usage required in `/plan` workflow
**Impact:** Plans based on current best practices (2025), not outdated patterns

### 3. "Next Steps" Format Determines Cross-Session Success

**Problem:** Vague next steps ("continue the work") unusable by new agent
**Solution:** Explicit paths, commands, initiative links, priority indicators
**Impact:** New AI agent can pick up work immediately from summary alone

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)

1. üî¥ **Critical:** Commit workflow and standards improvements

- Files: `.windsurf/workflows/{work,plan,meta-analysis}.md`, `docs/standards/SUMMARY_STANDARDS.md`
- Command: `git add -A && git commit`
- Message: Use conventional commit format with research references

### Next Session

1. üü° **High:** Test improved `/work` workflow with actual continuation

- Scenario: Start new session, run `/work`, verify it uses session summaries
- Expected: Agent reads 2-3 most recent summaries automatically
- Validation: Picks up from "Next Steps" without user prompting

1. üü¢ **Medium:** Continue docs/initiatives/active/quality-foundation.md Phase 2

- Tasks: Install markdownlint-cli2, configure Vale
- Estimated: 1-2 hours
- Context: See initiative file for full checklist

### Future

1. ‚ö™ **Low:** Create ADR documenting session summary strategy

- Decision: Session summaries as cross-session context mechanism
- Alternatives: Persistent database, conversation export, external memory
- Rationale: File-based, git-tracked, human-readable, AI-parseable
