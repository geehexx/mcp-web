# Session Summary: Workflow Artifacts & Transparency Fixes

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Session Type:** Critical System Fixes
**Status:** âœ… Phase 1 Complete

---

## Executive Summary

Fixed critical systemic issues affecting workflow task numbering, transparency, and artifact management. Users can now see real-time progress, understand which workflow created which task, and benefit from professional WBS numbering standards. Resolved file structure violations and implemented mandatory transparency requirements.

**Impact:** Transformed opaque workflow execution into transparent, trackable progress with industry-standard task numbering.

---

## Problem Statement

### Issues Discovered

**User Report:** Multiple systemic problems affecting workflow outputs and user experience:

1. **Missing Task Numbering:** Tasks created without hierarchical numbering (1, 1.1, 1.2.1)
2. **No Workflow Attribution:** Couldn't tell which workflow created which task
3. **Silent Updates:** Task transitions invisible to user
4. **File Structure Violations:** Both flat and folder formats created simultaneously
5. **Missing Workflow Calls:** Version bumping, ADR creation not triggered
6. **Wrong Workflow Names:** All tasks labeled `/work` even for child workflows

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause:** Task system integration (2025-10-18, commit `9e221ac`) added `update_plan` calls but:
- Didn't specify numbering format in examples
- Didn't add workflow prefix requirement
- No transparency/announcement requirements
- No guidance on parent-child numbering

**Secondary Issues:**
- Scaffolding system not used for new initiatives
- PROPOSAL file left in wrong location after implementation
- No pre-commit validation for structure violations

---

## Solution Implemented

### Phase 1: Core Orchestrator Fixes (Complete)

#### 1. File Structure Violations Resolved

**Actions Taken:**
- Moved `2025-10-18-workflow-automation-enhancement.md` â†’ `initiative.md` in folder
- Created proper folder structure for current initiative (phases/, artifacts/)
- Archived PROPOSAL to artifacts directory
- Verified compliance with ADR-0013 folder-based structure rules

**Structure Now:**
```
docs/initiatives/active/
â”œâ”€â”€ 2025-10-18-workflow-automation-enhancement/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ initiative.md (main file)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ implementation-examples.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ technical-design.md
â””â”€â”€ 2025-10-18-workflow-artifacts-and-transparency/
    â”œâ”€â”€ initiative.md (main file)
    â”œâ”€â”€ phases/ (empty, ready for future phases)
    â””â”€â”€ artifacts/
        â”œâ”€â”€ analysis.md (300+ lines root cause analysis)
        â”œâ”€â”€ implementation-plan.md (detailed strategy)
        â””â”€â”€ PROPOSAL-folder-based-structure.md (archived)
```

#### 2. Task Numbering Added to Core Workflows

**Updated Workflows:**

**`/work` workflow:**
- Added: `1. /work - Detect project context`
- Parent task 3 creates children: `3.1. /implement - Load context`
- Example shows full hierarchical numbering
- Transparency announcements: ðŸ”„ Entering, ðŸ“‹ Task Update, ðŸ”€ Routing

**`/implement` workflow:**
- Added: Numbering rules for parent-aware operation
- If called by parent (e.g., /work step 3), uses `3.1, 3.2, 3.3`
- If called directly, uses `1, 2, 3`
- Transparency: ðŸ”„ Entering Stage 1

**`/plan` workflow:**
- **Critical fix:** Added missing task creation (Stage 0)
- Was missing `update_plan` calls entirely!
- Now creates initial 6-task plan before planning
- Format: `1. /plan - Define problem and requirements`

**Standard Format Established:**
```typescript
{ step: "<number>. /<workflow> - <description>", status: "in_progress" }

Examples:
- Top-level: "1. /work - Detect context"
- Subtask: "  3.1. /implement - Load files" (2-space indent)
- Sub-subtask: "    3.1.1. /implement - Read initiative" (4-space indent)
```

#### 3. Transparency Requirements Added

**Mandatory Announcements:**

1. **Workflow Entry:** `ðŸ”„ **Entering Stage X: [Name]**`
2. **Task Creation:** `âœ“ Task plan created with N items`
3. **Task Updates:** `ðŸ“‹ **Task Update:** "X. /workflow - Task" â†’ status`
4. **Routing Decisions:** `ðŸ”€ **Routing Decision:** Continuing with /workflow`

**Result:** User now sees:
```
ðŸ”„ Entering Stage 1: Create Initial Task Plan
âœ“ Task plan created with 5 items
ðŸ“‹ Task Update: "1. /work - Detect context" â†’ completed
ðŸ”€ Routing Decision: Continuing with /implement workflow
ðŸ“‹ Task Update: Added 6 /implement subtasks (3.1-3.6)
```

#### 4. Agent Rules Updated (Section 1.11)

**Added to `.windsurf/rules/00_agent_directives.md`:**

**10 Critical Rules:**
1. **Mandatory numbering:** `<number>. /<workflow> - <description>` format
2. **Workflow prefix:** ALWAYS include (e.g., `/work`, `/implement`, `/analyze`)
3. **Period after number:** Required for WBS readability
4. **Hierarchical numbering:** Parent 3 â†’ children 3.1, 3.2; Parent 3.2 â†’ children 3.2.1, 3.2.2
5. **Indentation:** 2 spaces per hierarchy level
6. **One active task:** At most ONE `in_progress` at a time
7. **Specific tasks:** Clear completion criteria
8. **Reasonable scope:** 15-60 min each
9. **Sequential order:** List in execution order
10. **Print announcements:** ALWAYS print workflow entry and task updates

**Transparency Requirements:**
- Print before `update_plan`: workflow entry announcement
- Print after `update_plan`: confirmation with count
- Print on status change: task update with arrow notation

**Examples Provided:**
- Top-level workflow invocation
- Child workflow insertion with parent numbering
- Hierarchical task decomposition

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: WBS Numbering Standard

**Context:** No standard existed for task numbering
**Decision:** Adopt Microsoft Project WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) format
**Rationale:** Industry standard, hierarchical, clear parent-child relationships
**Source:** https://www.tacticalprojectmanager.com/task-numbers-ms-project/
**Format:** `1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1, 5.3` with periods after numbers

### Decision 2: Workflow Prefix Mandatory

**Context:** Tasks showed no workflow attribution
**Decision:** EVERY task must include `/<workflow>` prefix
**Rationale:** Clear ownership, enables debugging, professional appearance
**Format:** `1. /work - Description` not `1. Description`

### Decision 3: Transparency Over Silence

**Context:** User had no visibility into progress
**Decision:** Mandate announcements for all major transitions
**Rationale:** User experience, debugging, progress tracking
**Implementation:** Emoji-prefixed announcements (ðŸ”„ ðŸ“‹ ðŸ”€ âœ…)

### Decision 4: Fix Core 3, Defer Rest

**Context:** 17 workflows need updates
**Decision:** Update `/work`, `/implement`, `/plan` first (Phase 1)
**Rationale:** 80/20 rule - core orchestrators cover most use cases
**Remaining:** 14 specialized workflows in future sessions

## Key Learnings

### 1. Workflow Task Numbering Was Missing

**Discovery:** Despite task system integration (2025-10-18), numbering format was never specified
**Lesson:** Template changes require explicit format requirements, not just examples
**Application:** All future workflow templates must specify exact format with examples

### 2. /plan Workflow Had No Task Creation

**Discovery:** `/plan` workflow completely missing `update_plan` calls
**Lesson:** Workflow audits must check for task creation, not assume it exists
**Application:** Add validation: all orchestrator workflows MUST create initial plan

### 3. Transparency Requires Explicit Mandate

**Discovery:** Task updates happened silently - no user visibility
**Lesson:** Good UX requires explicit requirements, not implied behavior
**Application:** All workflow templates now mandate announcements

### 4. File Structure Violations Easy to Create

**Discovery:** Created both flat file and folder simultaneously
**Lesson:** Scaffolding system (scaffold.py) must be used, not manual creation
**Application:** Add pre-commit hook to detect structure violations

### 5. Child Workflow Numbering Complex

**Discovery:** No guidance on how child workflows number their tasks
**Lesson:** Hierarchical numbering needs explicit parent-child rules
**Application:** WBS standard (3 â†’ 3.1, 3.2 | 3.2 â†’ 3.2.1, 3.2.2) now documented

## Unresolved Issues / Future Work

### Immediate (Next Session)

1. **Fix Markdown Linting:** Analysis/implementation-plan docs have MD029 errors (list numbering)
2. **Update Remaining 14 Workflows:** Apply same pattern to specialized workflows
3. **Section Numbering Audit:** Fix inconsistencies across all workflows

### Short-Term (This Week)

4. **Version Bump Integration:** Add to `/commit` workflow (call `/bump-version` when appropriate)
5. **ADR Creation Triggers:** Add explicit triggers to `/plan` and `/implement`
6. **Pre-Commit Validation:** Add hook to catch structure violations

### Long-Term (Future)

7. **Workflow Template:** Create standardized template with all requirements
8. **Workflow Linting:** Automated validation of workflow format
9. **Documentation Generation:** Auto-generate workflow docs from templates
