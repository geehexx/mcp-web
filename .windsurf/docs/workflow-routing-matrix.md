# Workflow Routing Matrix

**Purpose:** Quick reference for `/work` routing decisions based on detected signals.

**Authority:** [work-routing.md](../workflows/work-routing.md)

---

## Confidence Levels

| Confidence | Threshold | Action | User Confirmation |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **High** | 80%+ | Auto-proceed | Not needed |
| **Medium** | 30-79% | Auto-proceed with alternatives | State recommendation, mention alternatives |
| **Low** | <30% | Prompt user | Ask for direction |

---

## Signal Priority Matrix

| Signal | Confidence | Route To | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Active initiative with "In Progress" tasks** | High (90%) | `/implement` | Clear continuation point |
| **Test failures detected** | High (85%) | Fix immediately or `/implement` | Blocking issue |
| **Uncommitted changes** | Medium (70%) | `/commit` | Clean state needed |
| **Initiative marked "Planning"** | High (80%) | `/plan` | Explicit planning phase |
| **Initiative marked "Completed"** | High (95%) | `/archive-initiative` | Cleanup required |
| **Multiple initiatives active** | Medium (50%) | Prompt user | Ambiguous priority |
| **Recent session summary exists** | Medium (60%) | Continue from summary | Context available |
| **Clean slate (no signals)** | Low (20%) | Prompt user | No clear direction |

---

## Common Routing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Active Initiative

**Signals:**

- Initiative file exists in `docs/initiatives/active/`
- Status: "Active" or "In Progress"
- Unchecked tasks present

**Confidence:** High (90%)

**Route:** `/implement`

**Reasoning:** Clear continuation point with defined tasks

---

### Scenario 2: Test Failures

**Signals:**

- `task test:fast` returns non-zero exit code
- Test output shows failures

**Confidence:** High (85%)

**Route:** Fix immediately or `/implement`

**Reasoning:** Blocking issue that prevents further work

---

### Scenario 3: Planning Markers

**Signals:**

- Initiative status: "Planning"
- No implementation tasks yet
- Research needed

**Confidence:** High (80%)

**Route:** `/plan`

**Reasoning:** Explicit planning phase indicated

---

### Scenario 4: Completed Initiative

**Signals:**

- Initiative status: "Completed" or "✅"
- All tasks checked
- No uncommitted changes

**Confidence:** High (95%)

**Route:** `/archive-initiative`

**Reasoning:** Cleanup required before new work

---

### Scenario 5: Uncommitted Changes

**Signals:**

- `git status --short` shows modified files
- No active initiative

**Confidence:** Medium (70%)

**Route:** `/commit`

**Reasoning:** Clean state needed, but unclear if work is complete

---

### Scenario 6: Multiple Active Initiatives

**Signals:**

- 2+ initiatives in `docs/initiatives/active/`
- No clear priority indicators

**Confidence:** Medium (50%)

**Route:** Prompt user

**Reasoning:** Ambiguous priority, user input needed

---

### Scenario 7: Recent Session Summary

**Signals:**

- Session summary exists in `docs/archive/session-summaries/`
- Date within last 7 days
- Summary indicates next steps

**Confidence:** Medium (60%)

**Route:** Continue from summary context

**Reasoning:** Context available, but may be stale

---

### Scenario 8: Clean Slate

**Signals:**

- No active initiatives
- No uncommitted changes
- No test failures
- No recent session summaries

**Confidence:** Low (20%)

**Route:** Prompt user

**Reasoning:** No clear direction, user input required

## Routing Examples

### Example 1: High Confidence

**Detected signals:**

```yaml
active_initiatives:
  - path: docs/initiatives/active/2025-10-20-feature-x/initiative.md
    status: Active
    progress: 60%
    unchecked_tasks: 5

git_status: clean
test_status: passing
```

**Routing decision:**

```text
Confidence: 90% (High)
Route: /implement
Rationale: Active initiative with clear tasks
Action: Auto-proceed without user confirmation
```

---

### Example 2: Medium Confidence

**Detected signals:**

```yaml
active_initiatives:
  - path: docs/initiatives/active/2025-10-18-refactor-y/initiative.md
    status: Active
    progress: 30%
  - path: docs/initiatives/active/2025-10-19-feature-z/initiative.md
    status: Active
    progress: 50%

git_status: clean
test_status: passing
```

**Routing decision:**

```text
Confidence: 50% (Medium)
Route: Prompt user
Rationale: Multiple active initiatives, unclear priority
Action: Present options:
  1. Continue feature-z (50% complete, more recent)
  2. Continue refactor-y (30% complete)
  3. Start new work
```

---

### Example 3: Low Confidence

**Detected signals:**

```yaml
active_initiatives: []
git_status: clean
test_status: passing
recent_summaries: []
```

**Routing decision:**

```text
Confidence: 20% (Low)
Route: Prompt user
Rationale: No clear signals, clean slate
Action: Ask: "What would you like to work on?"
```

---

## Override Signals

**User can override routing with explicit commands:**

| User Input | Override Route | Confidence |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| "Continue initiative X" | `/implement` (X) | 100% |
| "Plan new feature Y" | `/plan` | 100% |
| "Run tests" | `/validate` | 100% |
| "Commit changes" | `/commit` | 100% |
| "Archive completed work" | `/archive-initiative` | 100% |
