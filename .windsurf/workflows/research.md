**Invocation:** Called by `/plan` or standalone for research tasks

**Philosophy:** Good research prevents mistakes and identifies proven patterns.

---

## Stage 0: Workflow Entry

üîÑ **Entering /research:** Comprehensive research and pattern discovery

**Print workflow entry announcement:**

```markdown
üîÑ **Entering /research:** Gathering best practices and analyzing patterns
```

üîÑ **Entering Stage 2: Define Research Scope**

### Identify What to Research

**From requirement:**

- Technology/framework specifics
- Security considerations
- Performance implications
- Best practices for domain
- Similar implementations

**Example:**

```markdown
**Research Needed:**
- API key authentication best practices
- Python libraries for key hashing
- FastAPI security patterns
- OWASP API security guidelines
```

**Print stage completion:**

```markdown
üìã **Stage 2 Complete:** Research scope defined
```

**Update task plan:**

```typescript
update_plan({
  explanation: "Scope defined, moving to internal pattern search",
  plan: [
    { step: "1. /research - Define research scope", status: "completed" },
    { step: "2. /research - Search internal patterns", status: "in_progress" },
    { step: "  2.1. /research - Search codebase", status: "in_progress" },
    // ... rest of tasks
  ]
})
```

---

## Stage 3: Internal Pattern Discovery

üîÑ **Entering Stage 3: Internal Pattern Discovery**

### 2.1 Search Existing Codebase

**Look for similar patterns:**

```bash
# Search for related implementations
grep_search("auth|authentication|api.?key", "src/", recursive=true, includes=["*.py"])

# Check for existing security patterns
grep_search("hash|encrypt|secret", "src/", recursive=true, includes=["*.py"])
```

### 2.2 Review Related ADRs

```bash
# List all ADRs
ls docs/adr/*.md

# Search for security-related decisions
grep_search("security|auth|encrypt", "docs/adr/", recursive=true)
```

### 2.3 Check Project Rules

**Read relevant rules:**

```python
# Always check security rules for security-related work
mcp0_read_text_file("/home/gxx/projects/mcp-web/.windsurf/rules/04_security.md")

# Check testing standards
mcp0_read_text_file("/home/gxx/projects/mcp-web/.windsurf/rules/01_testing_and_tooling.md")
```

**Print stage completion:**

```markdown
üìã **Stage 3 Complete:** Internal patterns analyzed
```

**Update task plan:**

```typescript
update_plan({
  explanation: "Internal search complete, proceeding to web research",
  plan: [
    { step: "1. /research - Define research scope", status: "completed" },
    { step: "2. /research - Search internal patterns", status: "completed" },
    { step: "  2.1. /research - Search codebase", status: "completed" },
    { step: "  2.2. /research - Review ADRs", status: "completed" },
    { step: "  2.3. /research - Check project rules", status: "completed" },
    { step: "3. /research - Perform external web research", status: "in_progress" },
    { step: "  3.1. /research - Run web searches (5+ queries)", status: "in_progress" },
    // ... rest of tasks
  ]
})
```

## Stage 4: External Research (MANDATORY)

üîÑ **Entering Stage 4: External Research (MANDATORY)**

### 3.1 Web Search Strategy

**ALWAYS use web search for current best practices:**

**Search queries to run:**

1. **Broad best practices**

   ```text
   search_web("[Technology] best practices 2025")
   Example: "Python API authentication best practices 2025"
   ```

2. **Framework-specific**

   ```text
   search_web("[Framework] [Feature] guide 2025")
   Example: "FastAPI security authentication guide 2025"
   ```

3. **Security focus**

   ```text
   search_web("OWASP [Feature] security 2025")
   Example: "OWASP API security authentication 2025"
   ```

4. **Real-world examples**

   ```text
   search_web("[Technology] production examples [Feature]")
   Example: "Python JWT production examples authentication"
   ```

5. **Recent updates**

   ```text
   search_web("[Library] security vulnerabilities CVE 2024 2025")
   Example: "bcrypt security vulnerabilities CVE 2024 2025"
   ```

### 3.2 Document Findings

**For each search:**

```markdown
**Query:** [Search query used]
**Key Findings:**
- [Finding 1 with source URL]
- [Finding 2 with source URL]
- [Finding 3 with source URL]

**Recommendations:**
- [Actionable recommendation]
```

### 3.3 Compare Alternatives

**Create comparison table:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Use Case |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| API Keys | Simple, fast | Less secure than OAuth | Internal APIs, CLI tools |
| JWT | Stateless, scalable | Complex setup | Web apps, microservices |
| OAuth2 | Industry standard | Heavy implementation | Public APIs, 3rd party |

**Decision criteria:**

- Project requirements
- Complexity vs benefit
- Security needs
- Maintenance burden

**Print stage completion:**

```markdown
üìã **Stage 4 Complete:** External research finished, [N] sources analyzed
```

**Update task plan:**

```typescript
update_plan({
  explanation: "Web research complete, moving to technical assessment",
  plan: [
    // ... completed tasks ...
    { step: "3. /research - Perform external web research", status: "completed" },
    { step: "  3.1. /research - Run web searches (5+ queries)", status: "completed" },
    { step: "  3.2. /research - Document findings", status: "completed" },
    { step: "  3.3. /research - Compare alternatives", status: "completed" },
    { step: "4. /research - Technical assessment", status: "in_progress" },
    { step: "  4.1. /research - Analyze dependencies", status: "in_progress" },
    // ... rest of tasks
  ]
})
```

## Anti-Patterns

### ‚ùå Don't: Skip Web Research

**Bad:** "I think we should use X"
**Good:** "I researched X vs Y vs Z. X is best because [sources]"

### ‚ùå Don't: Use Outdated Sources

**Bad:** Using 2020 articles without checking for updates
**Good:** Prioritize 2024-2025 sources, note if using older

### ‚ùå Don't: Ignore Security

**Bad:** Pick fastest option without security review
**Good:** Evaluate security implications first

### ‚ùå Don't: Over-Research

**Bad:** Spend 4 hours researching for 1-hour task
**Good:** Research proportional to task complexity
