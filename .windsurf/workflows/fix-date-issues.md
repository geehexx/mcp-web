# Fix Date Issues

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED:** This workflow was created to fix date issues but has been superseded.
> All 2024 date references have been corrected to 2025 as of 2025-10-16.
> The project correctly started in October 2025.

This workflow was originally created to fix incorrect 2024 dates, but all issues have been resolved. The project timeline has been corrected:

## Fixes Applied

1. ✅ **Session Summaries**: All dates corrected to 2025
2. ✅ **Initiatives**: All Q4 references updated to 2025-Q4
3. ✅ **Documentation**: All 2025 references verified

## Historical Context

Originally identified files (now fixed):

- Session summaries: Dates corrected in content
- `docs/initiatives/active/2025-q4-quality-foundation.md` - Filename already correct
- `docs/initiatives/README.md` - References updated
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md` - Examples updated

## Verification

Run to check for any remaining issues:

```bash
grep -r "2024" docs/ .windsurf/ --include="*.md" | grep -v "archive" | grep -v "DEPRECATED"
```

**Result:** All 2024 references have been updated to 2025 where appropriate.
