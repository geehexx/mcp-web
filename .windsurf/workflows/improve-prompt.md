# Improve Prompt Workflow

**Purpose:** Systematically optimize prompts using Claude 3.5 Sonnet 4 and Windsurf best practices with quantitative validation.

**Invocation:** `/improve-prompt` followed by the prompt text, or reference a file containing the prompt

**Philosophy:** Good prompts are specific, structured, and guide model reasoning. Quantify improvements to validate effectiveness.

**Based on:** Anthropic Prompt Improver, Windsurf prompt engineering guidelines, Claude extended thinking capabilities

---

## When to Use

Use this workflow to improve:

- ‚úÖ Workflow prompts (in `.windsurf/workflows/`)
- ‚úÖ Rule definitions (in `.windsurf/rules/`)
- ‚úÖ Ad-hoc prompts for specific tasks
- ‚úÖ System prompts for tools/agents
- ‚úÖ Prompts showing inconsistent results
- ‚úÖ Prompts needing better structure

Do NOT use for:

- ‚ùå Changing fundamental roles or personas
- ‚ùå Altering security-critical validation logic
- ‚ùå Modifying established project rules without approval
- ‚ùå Prompts that are already highly optimized

## Stage 3: Analyze Current Prompt

üîÑ **Entering Stage 3: Analyze Current Prompt**

### 3.1 Quality Assessment

**Analyze against best practices:**

#### Clarity Dimensions

| Dimension | Score (0-10) | Issues Identified |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Clear objective** | [N] | [What's unclear about the goal?] |
| **Specific instructions** | [N] | [What steps are missing/vague?] |
| **Context provision** | [N] | [What context is missing?] |
| **Constraint definition** | [N] | [What constraints are unspecified?] |
| **Output format** | [N] | [How is output format unclear?] |
| **Example inclusion** | [N] | [Are examples present and clear?] |
| **Reasoning guidance** | [N] | [Does it guide step-by-step thinking?] |
| **Structure/organization** | [N] | [How could structure improve?] |

**Overall Baseline Score:** [Average of dimensions]/10

#### Specific Issues Matrix

**Critical Issues** (must fix):

- [ ] Ambiguous objective
- [ ] Missing critical context
- [ ] No output format specification
- [ ] Conflicting instructions

**High-Priority Improvements**:

- [ ] Add chain-of-thought reasoning
- [ ] Structure with XML tags
- [ ] Standardize examples
- [ ] Add step-by-step instructions
- [ ] Specify constraints clearly

**Medium-Priority Enhancements**:

- [ ] Improve example quality
- [ ] Add edge case handling
- [ ] Clarify terminology
- [ ] Enhance context references

**Low-Priority Polish**:

- [ ] Grammar/spelling corrections
- [ ] Formatting consistency
- [ ] Tone adjustment

### 3.2 Complexity Analysis

**Prompt Complexity Metrics:**

- **Cognitive Load:** [Low/Medium/High] - How much understanding required
- **Task Complexity:** [Simple/Moderate/Complex] - Nature of the task
- **Ambiguity Level:** [Low/Medium/High] - How much is left to interpretation
- **Context Dependency:** [Low/Medium/High] - How much external knowledge needed

**Recommendation:**

- Simple prompts ‚Üí Focus on clarity and format

**Print stage completion:**

```markdown
üìã **Stage 3 Complete:** Analysis complete - Baseline score: [N]/10, [X] critical issues, [Y] improvements identified
```

**Update task plan:**

```typescript
update_plan({
  explanation: "Analysis complete, applying optimizations",
  plan: [
    { step: "1. /improve-prompt - Capture and parse input prompt", status: "completed" },
    { step: "2. /improve-prompt - Analyze current prompt quality", status: "completed" },
    { step: "3. /improve-prompt - Apply optimization techniques", status: "in_progress" },
    // ... rest of tasks
  ]
})
```

## Stage 4: Apply Optimization Techniques

üîÑ **Entering Stage 4: Apply Optimization Techniques**

### 4.1 Core Optimization Strategies

Apply techniques in priority order based on analysis:

#### Technique 1: Add Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

**When:** Task complexity is moderate-high, or accuracy is critical

**How:**

```markdown
Before providing your final answer, think through the problem step by step:

1. [Step 1 description]
2. [Step 2 description]
3. [Step 3 description]

Wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags, then provide your final response.
```

**Example transformation:**

```markdown
<!-- Before -->
Summarize this article in 3 sentences.

<!-- After -->
Summarize this article in 3 sentences. Follow these steps:

1. Identify the main topic and key arguments
2. Note supporting evidence and examples
3. Synthesize into 3 concise sentences

Wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags:
<analysis>
[Your step-by-step thinking]
</analysis>

Then provide your final 3-sentence summary.
```

#### Technique 2: Structure with XML Tags

**When:** Prompt has multiple sections or complex inputs

**How:**

```markdown
<input>
[User input data]
</input>

<instructions>
[What to do with the input]
</instructions>

<constraints>
[Limitations and requirements]
</constraints>

<output_format>
[Expected output structure]
</output_format>
```

**Benefits:**

- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier for model to parse
- Reduces ambiguity
- Enables better context handling

#### Technique 3: Standardize Examples

**When:** Examples exist but inconsistently formatted

**How:**

```markdown
<examples>
  <example>
    <input>
    [Example input]
    </input>
    <reasoning>
    [Step-by-step thought process]
    </reasoning>
    <output>
    [Expected output]
    </output>
  </example>
</examples>
```

**Quality criteria:**

- Examples show reasoning, not just input/output
- Examples cover edge cases
- Examples demonstrate format exactly
- 2-5 examples (more = diminishing returns)

#### Technique 4: Add Step-by-Step Instructions

**When:** Task has multiple phases or decisions

**How:**

```markdown
Complete this task by following these steps in order:

1. **[Step 1 Name]:** [Detailed description]
   - [Sub-step 1a]
   - [Sub-step 1b]

2. **[Step 2 Name]:** [Detailed description]
   - [Sub-step 2a]
   - [Sub-step 2b]

3. **[Step 3 Name]:** [Detailed description]
```

**Best practices:**

- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bold for step names
- Include decision criteria
- Specify what to do at each step

#### Technique 5: Specify Output Format

**When:** Output format is important or currently unclear

**How:**

```markdown
Provide your response in this exact format:

```json
{
  "field1": "value",
  "field2": ["list", "of", "items"],
  "field3": {
    "nested": "structure"
  }
}
```

OR

```markdown
Format your response as:

**Section 1:** [Content]
**Section 2:** [Content]
**Section 3:** [Content]
```

#### Technique 6: Add Constraints

**When:** Boundaries or limitations are unclear

**How:**

```markdown
<constraints>
  - Output must be between 100-150 words
  - Use only information from the provided context
  - Do not include speculation or external knowledge
  - Maintain objective tone
  - Include at least 2 specific examples
</constraints>
```

#### Technique 7: Include Prefill Strategy

**When:** Output should always start with specific format

**How:**

Add prefill instruction:

```markdown
Begin your response with: "Analysis complete. "
```

Or for structured output:

```markdown
Start your response with the opening tag: <response>
```

#### Technique 8: Windsurf-Specific Enhancements

**For Windsurf context:**

```markdown
Use @-mentions to reference specific context:
- `@file:path/to/file.py` for specific files
- `@dir:src/module` for directories
- `@web` for web search when needed

Specify technical requirements:
- Framework: [FastAPI, React, etc.]
- Libraries: [specific versions if critical]
- Complexity constraints: [O(n) time, O(1) space]
- Security: [OWASP guidelines, input validation]
```

### 4.2 Apply Selected Techniques

**Based on analysis, apply techniques in optimal order:**

1. First: Structure (XML tags if beneficial)
2. Second: Chain-of-thought (if complex task)
3. Third: Step-by-step instructions
4. Fourth: Examples (standardize or add)
5. Fifth: Output format specification
6. Sixth: Constraints
7. Seventh: Prefill (if beneficial)
8. Eighth: Context-specific enhancements

**Generate improved prompt:**

```markdown
**Improved Prompt:**
[Full improved prompt here]
```

**Print stage completion:**

```markdown
üìã **Stage 4 Complete:** [N] optimization techniques applied
```

**Update task plan:**

```typescript
update_plan({
  explanation: "Optimizations applied, validating improvements",
  plan: [
    { step: "1. /improve-prompt - Capture and parse input prompt", status: "completed" },
    { step: "2. /improve-prompt - Analyze current prompt quality", status: "completed" },
    { step: "3. /improve-prompt - Apply optimization techniques", status: "completed" },
    { step: "4. /improve-prompt - Validate improvements", status: "in_progress" },
    // ... rest of tasks
  ]
})
```

## Anti-Patterns

### ‚ùå Don't: Blindly Apply All Techniques

**Bad:** Apply every optimization regardless of need

**Good:** Assess prompt type and complexity, apply only beneficial techniques

**Reason:** Over-engineering simple prompts wastes tokens and adds unnecessary complexity

### ‚ùå Don't: Change Intent or Role

**Bad:** Modify the fundamental purpose or role definition

**Good:** Preserve original intent while improving clarity and structure

**Reason:** Optimization should enhance, not alter, the prompt's purpose

### ‚ùå Don't: Ignore Context

**Bad:** Apply generic improvements without considering where prompt will be used

**Good:** Tailor improvements to context (Windsurf, production system, etc.)

**Reason:** Context-specific enhancements provide better results

### ‚ùå Don't: Skip Validation

**Bad:** Present improved prompt without checking intent preservation

**Good:** Always validate that improvements maintain original objectives

**Reason:** Broken prompts are worse than unoptimized ones

### ‚ùå Don't: Provide Only Improved Prompt

**Bad:** Just show the new prompt without explanation

**Good:** Include analysis, metrics, and rationale for changes

**Reason:** Understanding WHY changes were made enables learning and iteration

### ‚ùå Don't: Over-Optimize Length

**Bad:** Make prompt as short as possible

**Good:** Balance clarity and conciseness

**Reason:** Clarity is more important than brevity; extra words that add clarity are worth it

---

## Workflow Integration

### Called By

- User (direct invocation)
- Other workflows when prompt optimization needed
- During workflow development/refinement

### Calls

- None (this is a leaf workflow)

### Output

- Comprehensive improvement analysis
- Quantitative metrics (before/after scores)
- Improved prompt in markdown code block
- Implementation recommendations

---

## Performance Characteristics

**Typical Execution Time:** 2-5 minutes (depends on prompt complexity)

**Token Usage:** ~8,000-15,000 tokens (analysis + generation)

**Complexity Score:** 60/100 (moderate complexity)

**Success Rate:** >95% for well-formed inputs

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Analysis shows little room for improvement

**Cause:** Prompt is already well-optimized

**Solution:** Provide minor polish only; explain that prompt is already high-quality

### Issue: Improved prompt changes intent

**Cause:** Over-optimization or misunderstanding of objective

**Solution:** Revert problematic changes, focus on structure/clarity only

### Issue: Metrics don't show expected improvement

**Cause:** Baseline was already high, or improvements are qualitative

**Solution:** Explain that some improvements (like better examples) may not show in numeric scores but still add value

### Issue: User disagrees with improvements

**Cause:** Different priorities or constraints not captured

**Solution:** Ask for specific feedback, iterate with user's guidance
